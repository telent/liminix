    GL.iNet GL-AR750
    ****************

    The GL-AR750 "Creta" travel router features:

     - QCA9531 @650Mhz SoC
     - dual band wireless: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac
     - two 10/100Mbps LAN ports and one WAN
     - 128MB DDR2 RAM
     - 16MB NOR Flash
     - supported in OpenWrt by the "ath79" SoC family

    As with many GL.iNet devices, the stock vendor firmware
    is a fork of OpenWrt, meaning that the plain binary
    ``firmware.bin`` that Liminix builds can be flashed using the
    vendor web UI and the U-Boot emergency "unbrick" routine

    The GL-AR750 has two distinct sets of wifi hardware. The 2.4GHz
    radio is part of the QCA9531 SoC, i.e. it's on the same silicon as
    the CPU, the Ethernet, the USB etc. The device is connected to the
    host via AHB, the "Advanced High-Performance Bus" and it is
    supported in Linux using the ath9k driver. The 5GHz support, on the
    other hand, is provided by a QCA9887 PCIe (PCI embedded) WLAN chip:
    I haven't looked closely at the router innards to see if this is
    actually physically a separate board that could be unplugged, but
    as far as Linux is concerned it behaves as one. This is
    supported by the ath10k driver.
