== Tutorial

Liminix is very configurable, which can make it initially quite daunting
- especially if you're learning Nix or Linux or networking concepts at
the same time. In this section we build some "worked example" Liminix
images to introduce the concepts. If you follow the examples exactly,
they should work. If you change things as you go along, they may work
differently or not at all, but the experience should be educational
either way.

=== Requirements

You will need a reasonably powerful computer running Nix. Target devices
for Liminix are unlikely to have the CPU power and disk space to be able
to build it in situ, so the build process is based around
"cross-compilation" from another computer. The build machine can be any
reasonably powerful desktop/laptop/server PC running NixOS. Standalone
Nixpkgs installations on other Linux distributions - or on MacOS, or
even in a Docker container - also ought to work but are untested.

=== Running in Qemu

You can try out Liminix without even having a router to play with. Clone
the Liminix git repository and change into its directory

[source,console]
----
git clone https://gti.telent.net/dan/liminix
cd liminix
----

Now build Liminix

[source,console]
----
nix-build -I liminix-config=./examples/hello-from-qemu.nix \
 --arg device "import ./devices/qemu" -A outputs.default
----

In this command `+liminix-config+` points to the desired software
configuration (e.g. services, users, filesystem, secrets) and `+device+`
describes the hardware (or emulated hardware) to run it on.
`+outputs.default+` tells Liminix that we want the default image output
for flashing to the device: for the Qemu "hardware" it's an alias for
`+outputs.vmbuild+`, which creates a directory containing a root
filesystem image and a kernel.

[TIP]
====
The first time you run this it may take several hours, because it builds
all of the dependencies including a full MIPS gcc and library toolchain.
Once those intermediate build products are in the nix store, subsequent
builds will be much faster - practically instant, if nothing has
changed.
====

Now you can try it:

[source,console]
----
./result/run.sh
----

This starts the Qemu emulator with a bunch of useful options, to run the
Liminix configuration you just built. It connects the emulated device's
serial console and the
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/monitor.html[QEMU monitor] to
stdin/stdout.

You should now see Linux boot messages and after a few seconds be
presented with a root shell prompt. You can run commands to look at the
filesystem, see what processes are running, view log messages (in
:file:/run/log/current), etc. To kill the emulator, press ^P (Control P)
then c to enter the "QEMU Monitor", then type `+quit+` at the `+(qemu)+`
prompt.

To see that it's running network services we need to connect to its
emulated network. Start the machine again, if you had stopped it, and
open up a second terminal on your build machine. We're going to run
another virtual machine attached to the virtual network, which will
request an IP address from our Liminix system and give you a shell you
can run ssh from.

We use https://www.system-rescue.org/[System Rescue] in tty mode (no
graphical output) for this example, but if you have some other favourite
Linux Live CD ISO - or, for that matter, any other OS image that QEMU
can boot - adjust the command to suit.

Download the System Rescue ISO:

[source,console]
----
curl https://fastly-cdn.system-rescue.org/releases/10.01/systemrescue-10.01-amd64.iso -O
----

and run it

[source,console]
----
nix-shell -p qemu --run " \
qemu-system-x86_64 \
-echr 16 \
-m 1024 \
-cdrom systemrescue-10.01-amd64.iso \
-netdev socket,mcast=230.0.0.1:1235,localaddr=127.0.0.1,id=lan \
-device virtio-net,disable-legacy=on,disable-modern=off,netdev=lan,mac=ba:ad:3d:ea:21:01 \
-display none -serial mon:stdio"
----

System Rescue displays a boot menu at which you should select the
"serial console" option, then after a few moments it boots to a root
prompt. You can now try things out:

* run `+ip a+` and see that it's been allocated an IP address in the
range 10.3.0.0/16.
* run `+ping 10.3.0.1+` to see that the Liminix VM responds
* run `+ssh root@10.3.0.1+` to try logging into it.

Congratulations! You have installed your first Liminix system - albeit
it has no practical use and it's not even real. The next step is to try
running it on hardware.

=== Installing on hardware

For the next example, we're going to install onto an actual hardware
device. These steps have been tested using a GL.iNet GL-MT300A, which
has been chosen for the purpose because it's cheap and easy to unbrick
if necessary.

[WARNING]
====
There is always a risk of rendering your device unbootable by flashing
it with an image that doesn't work. The GL-MT300A has a builtin
"debrick" procedure in the boot monitor and is also comparatively simple
to attach serial cables to (soldering not required), so it is lower-risk
than some devices. Using some other Liminix-supported MIPS hardware
device also _ought_ to work here, but you accept the slightly greater
bricking risk if it doesn't.
====

See <<_supported_hardware>> for device support status.

You may want to read and inwardly digest the section about <<serial>>
connections when you start working with Liminix on real hardware. You
won't _need_ serial access for this example, assuming it works, but it
allows you to see the boot monitor and kernel messages, and to login
directly to the device if for some reason it doesn't bring its network
up.

Now we can build Liminix. Although we could use the same example
configuration as we did for Qemu, you might not want to plug a DHCP
server into your working LAN because it will compete with the real DHCP
service. So we're going to use a different configuration with a DHCP
client: this is `+examples/hello-from-mt300.nix+`

It's instructive to compare the two configurations:

[source,console]
----
diff -u examples/hello-from-qemu.nix examples/hello-from-mt300.nix
----

You'll see a new `+boot.tftp+` stanza which you can ignore,
`+services.dns+` has been removed, and the static IP address allocation
has been replaced by a `+dhcp.client+` service.

[source,console]
----
nix-build -I liminix-config=./examples/hello-from-mt300.nix \
 --arg device "import ./devices/gl-mt300a" -A outputs.default
----

[TIP]
====
The first time you run this it may take several hours. Again? Yes, even
if you ran the previous example. Qemu is set up as a big-endian system
whereas the MediaTek SoC on this device is little-endian - so it
requires building all of the dependencies including an entirely
different MIPS gcc and library toolchain to the other one.
====

This time in `+result/+` you will see a bunch of files. Most of them you
can ignore for the moment, but `+result/firmware.bin+` is the firmware
image you can flash.

==== Flashing

Again, there are a number of different ways you could do this: using
TFTP with a serial cable, through the stock firmware's web UI, or using
the https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/3/tutorials/debrick/[vendor's
"debrick" process]. The last of these options has a lot to recommend it
for a first attempt:

* it works no matter what firmware is currently installed
* it doesn't require plugging a router into the same network as your
build system and potentially messing up your actual upstream
* no need to open the device and add cables

You can read detailed instructions on the vendor site, but the short
version is:

[arabic]
. turn the device off
. connect it by ethernet cable to a computer
. configure the computer to have static ip address 192.168.1.10
. while holding down the Reset button, turn the device on
. after about five seconds you can release the Reset button
. visit http://192.168.1.1/ using a web browser on the connected
computer
. click on "Browse" and choose `+result/firmware.bin+`
. click on "Update firmware"
. wait a minute or so while it updates.

There's no feedback from the web interface when the flashing is
finished, but what should happen is that the router reboots and starts
running Liminix. Now you need to figure out what address it got from
DHCP - e.g. by checking the DHCP server logs, or maybe by pinging
`+hello.lan+` or something. Once you've found it on the network you can
ping it and ssh to it just like you did the Qemu example, but this time
for real.

[WARNING]
====
Do not leave the default root password in place on any device exposed to
the internet! Although it has no writable storage and no default route,
a motivated attacker with some imagination could probably still do
something awful using it.
====

Congratulations Part II! You have installed your first Liminix system on
actual hardware - albeit that it _still_ has no practical use.

Exercise for the reader: change the default password by editing
`+examples/hello-from-mt300.nix+`, and then create and upload a new
image that has it set to something less hopeless.

=== Routing

The third example `+examples/demo.nix+` is a fully-functional home "WiFi
router" - although you will have to edit it a bit before it will
actually work for you. Copy `+examples/demo.nix+` to `+my-router.nix+`
(or other name of your choice) and open it in your favourite text
editor. Everywhere that the text `+EDIT+` appears is either a place you
probably want to change or a place you almost certainly need to change.

There's a lot going on in this configuration:

* it provides a wireless access point using the `+hostapd+` service: in
this stanza you can change the ssid, the channel, the passphrase etc.
* the wireless lan and wired lan are bridged together with the
`+bridge+` service, so that your wired and wireless clients appear to be
on the same network.

[TIP]
====
If you were using a hardware device that provides both 2.4GHz and 5GHz
wifi, you'd probably find that it has two wireless devices (often called
wlan0 and wlan1). In Liminix we handle this by running two `+hostapd+`
services, and adding both of them to the network bridge along with the
wired lan. (You can see an example in `+examples/rotuer.nix+`)
====

* we use the combination DNS and DHCP daemon provided by the `+dnsmasq+`
service, which you can configure
* the upstream network is "PPP over Ethernet", provided by the `+pppoe+`
service. Assuming that your ISP uses this standard, they will have
provided you with a PPP username and password (sometimes this will be
listed as "PAP" or "CHAP") which you can edit into the configuration
* this example supports the
newfootnote:[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1883[RFC1883
Internet Protocol&#44; Version 6] was published in 1995, so only "new"
when Bill Clinton was US President] Internet Protocol v6 as well as
traditional IPv4. Configuring IPv6 seems to vary from one ISP to the
next: this example expects them to be providing IP address allocation
and "prefix delegation" using DHCP6.

Build it using the same method as the previous example

[source,console]
----
nix-build -I liminix-config=./my-router.nix \
 --arg device "import ./devices/gl-mt300a" -A outputs.default
----

and then you can flash it to the device.

==== Bonus: in-place updates

This configuration uses a writable filesystem (see the line
`+rootfsType = "jffs2"+`), which means that once you've flashed it for
the first time, you can make further updates over SSH onto the running
router. To try this, make a small change (I'd suggest changing the
hostname) and then run

[source,console]
----
nix-build  -I liminix-config=./my-router.nix \
  --arg device "import ./devices/gl-ar750" \
  -A outputs.systemConfiguration && \
result/install.sh root@address-of-the-device 
----

(This requires the device to be network-accessible from your build
machine, which for a test/demo system might involve a second network
device in your build system - USB ethernet adapters are cheap - or a bit
of messing around unplugging cables.)

For more information about in-place-updates, see the manual section
`+Rebuilding the system+`.

=== Final thoughts

* These are demonstration configs for pedagogical purposes. If you'd
like to see some more realistic uses of Liminix,
`+examples/rotuer,arhcive,extneder.nix+` are based on some actual real
hosts in my home network.
* The technique used here for flashing was chosen mostly because it
doesn't need much infrastructure/tooling, but it is a bit of a faff
(requires physical access, vendor specific). There are slicker ways to
do it that need a bit more setup - we'll talk about that later as well.
