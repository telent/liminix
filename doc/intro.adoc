== Introduction

Liminix is a Nix-based collection of software tailored for domestic wifi
router or IoT device devices, of the kind that OpenWrt or DD-WRT or
Gargoyle or Tomato run on.

This is not NixOS-on-your-router: it's aimed at devices that are
underpowered for the full NixOS experience. It uses busybox tools, musl
instead of GNU libc, and s6-rc instead of systemd.

The Liminix name comes from Liminis, in Latin the genitive declension of
"limen", or "of the threshold". Your router stands at the threshold of
your (online) home and everything you send to/receive from the outside
word goes across it.
