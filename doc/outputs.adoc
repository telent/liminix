== Outputs

Liminix _outputs_ are artefacts that can be installed somehow on a
target device, or "installers" which run on the target device to perform
the installation.

There are different outputs because different target devices need
different artefacts, or have different ways to get that artefact
installed. The options available for a particular device are described
in the section for that device.
