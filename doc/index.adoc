= Supported hardware

=== Recommended devices

For development, the supported GL.iNet devices are all good choices if
you can find them, as they have a builtin "debrick" procedure in the
boot monitor and are also comparatively simple to attach serial cables
to (soldering not required), so are lower-risk than some other devices.

For a more powerful device, something with an ath10k wireless would be
the safe bet, or the Linksys E8450 which seems popular in the OpenWrt
community.
