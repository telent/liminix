Making quite reasonable progress, though only running under emulation.
Since almost everything so far has been a recap of nixwrt, that's to
be expected.

The example config starts some services at boot, or at least attempts
to. Next we shoud

 - add some network config to run-qemu
 - implement udhcp and odhcp properly to write outputs
  and create resolv.conf and all that
 - write some kind of test so we can refactor the crap
 - not let the tests write random junk everywhere

We can store outputs in the s6 scan directory, it seems:

> There is, however, a guarantee that s6-supervise will never touch subdirectories named data or env. So if you need to store user information in the service directory with the guarantee that it will never be mistaken for a configuration file, no matter the version of s6, you should store that information in the data or env subdirectories of the service directory.

what network peers do we want to model for testing?

- wan: pppoe
- wan: ip over ethernet, w/ dhcp service provided
- wan: l2tp over (ip over ethernet, w/ dhcp service provided)
- lan: something with a dhcp client

https://accel-ppp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ could use this for testing
pppoe and l2tp?


Thu Sep 22 22:57:47 BST 2022

To build a nixos vm with accel-ppp installed (not yet configured)

  nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A vm -I nixos-config=./tests/ppp-server-configuration.nix -o ppp-server
  QEMU_OPTS="-display none -serial mon:stdio -nographic" ./ppp-server/bin/run-nixos-vm

To test it's configured I thought I'd run it against an OpenWrt qemu
install, so, fun with qemu networking ensues. This config in ../openwrt-qemu
is using two multicast socket networks -

nix-shell -p qemu --run "./run.sh ./openwrt-22.03.0-x86-64-generic-kernel.bin openwrt-22.03.0-x86-64-generic-ext4-rootfs.img "

so hopefully we can spin up other VMs connected either to its lan or
its wan: *however* we do first need to configure its wan to use pppoe

uci set network.wan=interface
uci set network.wan.device='eth1'
uci set network.wan.proto='pppoe'
uci set network.wan.username='db123@a.1'
uci set network.wan.password='NotReallyTheSecret'

(it's ext4 so this will probably stick)

TODO - bugs, missing bits, other infelicities as they occur to me:

DONE 1) shutdown doesn't work as its using the busybox one not s6.

2) perhaps we shouldn't have process-based services like dhcp, ppp
implement "address provider interface" - instead have a separate
service for interface address that depends on the service and uses its
output

* ppp is not like dhcp because dhcp finds addresses for an existing
  interface but ppp makes a new one

3) when I killed ppp it restarted, but I don't think it reran
defaultroute which is supposed to depend on it. (Might be important
e.g. if we'd been assigned a different IP address). Investigate
semantics of s6-rc service dependencies

DONE 4) make the pppoe test run unattended

5) write a test for udhcp

6) squashfs size is ~ 14MB for a configuration with not much in it,
look for obvious wastes of space

7) some of the pppoe config should be moved into a ppp service

8) some of configuration.nix (e.g. defining routes) should be moved into
tools

DONE 9) split tools up instead of having it all one file

10) is it OK to depend on squashfs pseudofiles if we might want to
switch to ubifs? will there always be a squashfs underneath? might
we want to change the pseudofiles in an overlay?

11) haven't done (overlayfs) overlays at all

12) overlay.nix needs splitting up

13) upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option

14) add ipv6 support generally

15) "ip address add" seems to magically recognise v4 vs v6 but
is that specified or fluke?

16) tighten up the module specs. (DONE) services.foo should be a s6-rc
service, (DONE) kernel config should be checked in some way

DONE 17) rename nixwrt references in kernel builder

18) maybe stop suffixing all the service names with .service

19) syslogd - use busybox or s6?

chat -s -S ogin:--ogin: root / "ip address show dev ppp0 | grep ppp0" 192.168.100.1  "/nix/store/*-s6-linux-init-*/bin/s6-linux-init-hpr -p"


Working towards a general goal of having a derivation we can
usefully run `nix path-info` on - or some other tool that will
tell us what's making the images big. The squashfs doesn't
have this information.

Towards that end (really? can't remember how ...) what would be a
way for packages to declare "I want to add files to /etc"? Is that
even a good idea?

Thinking we should turn s6-init-files back into a real derivation.

> Thinking we should turn s6-init-files back into a real derivation.

This turns out to be Not That Simple, because it contains weird shit
(sticky bits and fifos).

Tue Sep 27 09:50:44 BST 2022

* allow modules to register activation scripts that are run on the
root filesystem once all packages are installed

  - do they run on build or on host? if we're upgrading in place
  how do we ship filesystem changes to the host?

or:

* allow modules to declare environment.*, use pseudofile on build and
create real files on host. will need to keep the implementation on
  host faily simple because restricted environment

Tue Sep 27 16:14:18 BST 2022

TODO list is getting both longer and shorter, though longer on
average.

2) perhaps we shouldn't use process-based services like [ou]dhcp as
queryable endpoint for interface addresses (e.g. when adding routes).
Instead have a separate service for interface address that depends on
the *dhcp and uses its output

3) when I killed ppp it restarted, but I don't think it reran
defaultroute which is supposed to depend on it. (Might be important
e.g. if we'd been assigned a different IP address). Investigate
semantics of s6-rc service dependencies

4) figure out a nice way to fit ppp into this model as it actually
creates the interface instead of using an existing unconfigured one

5) write a test for udhcp

7) some of the pppoe config should be moved into a ppp service

11) haven't done (overlayfs) overlays at all

13) upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option, move ppp and pppoe derivations into their own files

14) add ipv6 support generally

15) "ip address add" seems to magically recognise v4 vs v6 but
is that specified or fluke?

19) ship logs somehow to log collection system

21) dhcp, dns, hostap service for lan

22) support real hardware

Tue Sep 27 22:00:36 BST 2022

Found the cause of huge image size: rp-pppoe ships with scripts that
reference build-time packages, so we have x86-64 glibc in there

We don't need syslog just to accommodate ppp, there's an underdocumented
option for it to log to a file descriptor

Wed Sep 28 16:04:02 BST 2022

Based on https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/431953 if we can forge
ethernet packets we might be able to write tests for e.g. "is the vm
running a dhcp server"

Wed Sep 28 21:29:05 BST 2022

We can use Python "scapy" to generate dhcp request packets, and Python
'socket' model to send them encapsulated in UDP. Win

It's extremely janky python

Thu Sep 29 15:24:37 BST 2022

Two points to ponder

1) where service config depends on outputs of other services, we
do that rather ugly "$(cat ${output ....})" construct. Can we improve on
that? Maybe we could have some kind of tooling to read them as environment
variables ...

2) we have given no consideration yet to secrets. we want the secrets to
be not in the store; we want some way of refreshing them when they change

Sat Oct  1 14:24:21 BST 2022

The MAC80211_HWSIM kernel config creates virtual wlan[01] devices
which hostapd will work with, and a hwsim0 which we can use to monitor
(though not inject) trafic. Could we use this for wifi tests? How do
we make the guest hwsim0 visible to the host?


Sat Oct  1 18:41:31 BST 2022

virtual serial ports: I struggled with qemu for ages to get this to work.
You also need the unhelpfully named CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE option in
kconfig

QEMU_OPTIONS="-nodefaults  -chardev socket,path=/tmp/wlan,server=on,wait=off,id=wlan  -device virtio-serial-pci -device virtserialport,name=wlan,chardev=wlan"

Sun Oct  2 09:34:48 BST 2022

We could implement the secrets store as a service, then the secrets
are outputs.

Things we can do in qemu

1) make interface address service that depends on dhcp, instead of
  being set by it directly
2) check out restart behaviour of dependent services when depended-on
  service dies
3) pppd _creates_ an interface, work out how to fit it into this model
5) add bridge support for lan
8) upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option, move ppp and pppoe derivations into their own files
9) get ipv6 address from pppoe
10) get ipv6 delegation from pppoe and add prefix to lan
11) support dhcp6 in dnsmasq, and advertise prefix on lan
12) firewalling and nat
 - default deny or zero trust?
14) write secrets holder as a service with outputs
20) should we check that references to outputs actually correspond with
  those provided by a service

Things we probably do on hardware

6) writable filesystem (ubifs?)
7) overlay with squashfs/ubifs - useful? think about workflows for
how this thing is installed
16) gl-ar750
17) mediatek device - gl-mt300 or whatever I have lying around
18) some kind of arm (banana pi router?)
19) should we give routeros a hardware ethernet and maybe an l2tp upstream,
 then we could dogfood the hardware devices.  we could run an l2tp service
 at mythic-beasts, got a /48 there



https://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-fghack.html looks like a handy thing
we hope we'll never have to use

Sun Oct  2 22:22:17 BST 2022

> make interface address service that depends on dhcp, instead of being set by it directly

We can do this for dhcp, but we can't do it for ppp. Running the ppp service
creates a ppp[012n] interface and assigns it an ipv4 address and there's not
a whole lot we can easily do to unbundle that.

So

- the ppp service needs to behave as if it were a "link" service
- either it *also* needs to behave as an address service, or we could
  have an address service that subscribes to it and does nothing other than
  translate output formats

Note regarding that second bullet: at the moment the static address
service has no outputs anyway!

While trying to make the TFTP workflow not awful I seem to have written
a TFTP server.


Thu Oct  6 19:26:40 BST 2022

We have a booting kernel on gl-ar750, but we aren't at a point that it can
find a root filesystem

I'd *like* to be able to use the same delivery mechanism (kernel uimage
concatenated monolithic


Sat Oct  8 11:12:09 BST 2022

We have it booting on hardware, mounting root fs, running getty :-)

For NixWRT TFTP boots we used a single image with both kernel and squashfs, and
relied on CONFIG_MTD_SPLIT_FIRMWARE to identify where the boundary was and create
/dev/mdtn devices at the right offsets so that the kernel could find the
squashfs

For Liminix we're not going to do that.

* CONFIG_MTD_SPLIT_FIRMWARE is only available in OpenWrt patches
* it's an uncomfortable level of automagic just to save us doing two TFTPs
  instea of one
* the generated image is anyway not the one we'd write to flash (has unneeded
   PHRAM support)
* it means we need to memmap out enough ram for the whole image inc kernel when really
  all we need to reserve is the rootfs bit


Sat Oct  8 11:23:08 BST 2022

"halt" and "reboot" don't work on gl-ar750

Sat Oct  8 13:10:00 BST 2022

Where do we go with this ar750?

- wired networking
- wifi


Sun Oct  9 09:57:35 BST 2022

We want to be able to package kernel modules as regular derivations, so that
they get added to the filesystem

This means they need access to kernel.modulesupport

This means  kernel.modulesupport needs to be in pkgs too?

This is fine, probably, but we'd like to avoid closing over vmlinux because
there's no need for it to be in the filesystem

Mon Oct 10 22:57:23 BST 2022

The problem is that kernel kconfig options are manipulated in the
liminix modules, which means that data must be (transitively) available
to modules, so they can't be regular packages as they're tied so tightly
to the exact config. Unless we define a second overlay that references
the configuration object, but my head hurts when I start to think about that
so maybe not.

Tue Oct 11 00:00:13 BST 2022

Building ag71xx (ethernet driver) as a module doesn't work because
it references a symbol ath79_pll_base in the kernel that hasn't been
marked with EXPORT_SYMBOL.

We could forge an object file that "declares" it with a gross and disgusting hack like this

$ echo > empty # not actually "empty", objcopy complains about that
$ grep ath79_pll_base /nix/store/jcc114cd13xa8aa4mil35rlnmxnlmv09-vmlinux-mips-unknown-linux-musl-modulesupport/System.map
ffffffff807b2094 B ath79_pll_base
$ mips-unknown-linux-musl-objcopy   -I binary -O elf32-big --add-section .bss=empty  --add-symbol ath79_pll_base=.bss:0x807b2094  empty f.o

I don't claim this is a good idea, just an idea. Thought was that we would not
have to declare its type this way. Also it might not work with kaslr
https://stackoverflow.com/a/68903503


Backstory: why are we trying to build this as a module? because the
openwrt fork of it seems to be a bit more advanced than the mainline,
and I *suspect* that the mainline version doesn't work with our
openwrt-based device tree which ahs the mdio as a nested node inside
the ag71xx node - in mainline the driver seems to have all the mdio
stuff inline. So, could we build the openwrt driver without patching
the crap out of our kernel

Sun Oct 16 15:25:33 BST 2022

Executive decision: let's use the openwrt kernel (at least for
gl-ar750).  Mainline kernel doesn’t have devicetree support for this
device or the SoC it’s based on, and the OpenWrt dts for it doesn’t
have the same "compatible"s, which makes me think that an indefinite
amount of patching will be necessary to make dts/modules for one of
them work with a kernel for the other

As a result: now we have eth0 appearing, but not eth1?  Guessing we
need to add some kconfig for the switch

Mon Oct 17 21:23:37 BST 2022

we are spending ridiculous amounts of cpu/io time copying kernel source
trees from place to place, because we have kernel tree preparation
and actual building as two separate derivations.

I think the answer is to have a generic kernel build derivation
in the overlay, and then have the device overlays override it with
an additional phase to do openwrt patching or whatever else they
need to do.

Tue Oct 18 23:02:43 BST 2022

* previous TODO list is Aug 02, need to review
* dts is hardcoded to gl-ar750, that needs cleaning up

Wed Feb  8 16:52:22 GMT 2023

We have hydra builds for all the previously-working devices, though we
don't yet know if any of those builds actually boots or does anything
useful.

[DONE] Would be nice to clean up the run-qemu and connect-qemu scripts
and put them in the buildEnv

Some thought needed about how to hook up the gl-ar750 to the internets,
ideally in a way that mirrors typical real uses. AAISP have an L2TP
service, but I would prefer to use pppoe on the device, so how to
translate one to t'other on an intermediary/gateway machine?
https://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=3817#gsc.tab=0 exists
as an RFC but I can't find anything that actually implements it

Actual Documentation (e.g.  user and developer manuals) should live in
the liminix repo so it corresponds with the code, and can be rsynced
from there to the web site, maybe with a deploy hook or something.
Haven't decided what a good doc format is yet

If we create a flake for Hydra to run on, that _more or less_ means we
don't have any manual hydra jobset configuration to document.

There are still some tests that need adding to CI

[DONE] Should the per-device config be a module not an overlay? Given that
half of what's in it is kernel config (a module could set this)
and the rest is source tarball download specs (needs nixpkgs,
a module has this and could set it too) I wonder why it isn't already

[ALREADY DOES] Can we make Hydra report output sizes so we can plot closure size
trends and see if it all goes awful?

Thu Feb  9 08:14:39 GMT 2023

For better developer experience, I am thinking that either (1)
swap tasks 2 and 3 (writable filesystem before module system)
or (2) add NBD support so I can iterate on a real device without
full rebuilds every time

The reason we would like to run PPPoE instead of L2TP on the "rotuer" device is

- closer to real world scenario
- means no need to run dhcp client on the wan interface before we
   even get to start the l2tpd

if the gl-ar750 is connected to an ethernet card that linux is ignoring,
we're going to have to set up _some_ qemu thing just to run tftp from.

Tue Feb 14 17:59:34 GMT 2023

We should do a derivation that creates an ISO image and a qemu shell
script based on a configuration.nix, and put it in buildEnv. We'll
call it "borderNetVm" :

> A broadband remote access server (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes
  traffic to and from broadband remote access devices such as digital
  subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM) on an Internet service
  provider's (ISP) network.[1][2] BRAS can also be referred to as a
  broadband network gateway or border network gateway (BNG).[3]

(for consistency we should rename the "access" qemu socket network to
match whatever we call this)

 rm border.qcow2 ; nix-shell --argstr liminix `pwd`  --argstr nixpkgs `pwd`/../nixpkgs  --argstr unstable `pwd`/../unstable-nixpkgs/ ci.nix -A buildEnv --run "run-border-vm"

Wed Feb 15 22:56:59 GMT 2023

configuration for border vm needs to come from somewhere so it's good
for more people than just me

- pci device for setting up the ethernet
- lns address
- uid so it can do 9p shares? do we need to map things here?

also need to document the host-side bits so that people can set up
their spare ethernet as vfio

next step for hacking is to figure out what I was doing with pppoe

Sat Feb 18 14:26:45 GMT 2023

Apparently we're not currently doing anything special with busybox,
just using the default nixos build with the default applets.

We'd like to be able to say in modules which applets they need,
so that we build all necessary applets but don't waste any space.
But we don't want to build a busybox for each module because that
would be a big waste of space.

One option:
- add busybox configuration to `config` so that modules can maul it
- add a busybox module that builds it with union of all config and
 adds link in /bin
- make everything else look in /bin instead of referencing pkgs.busybox

It would be good if services could assert somehow that their required
config is present

We have ath9k listening for packets. To make this ready to use:

- need to load the modules
- enable bridging lan with wlan
- packet forwarding
- firewall


Mon Feb 20 20:41:17 GMT 2023

need to fix all the other broken ci jobs :-(

The wlan test is failing because we moved mac80211 to a module and
there's nothing running to insmod it

Wed Feb 22 18:17:17 GMT 2023

bridge is e2b3738d0f8c3f2fd76ebcef65612de502a7b121 but it's the wrong
way around: the master interface needs to be up whether or not all
of its children are, so members depend on master not vice versa

Next steps:
- re-implement bridge, enable bridging lan with wlan
- packet forwarding
- firewall
- ath10k
- ipv6

Fri Feb 24 23:37:56 GMT 2023

bridging wlan was made complex because can't add a device to a bridge
until it's operational, and wlan0 is not operational until hostapd
has churned awhile. Therefore, "waitup" listens for netlink messages
and notifies s6 readiness stuff

we have a firewall nft script but we're not running it on boot

we have forwarding but no dns, maybe because we haven't told
dnsmasq about any upstream servers

Sun Feb 26 21:08:47 GMT 2023

to add firmware we need to put files in /lib/firmware, which means
a module

i guess we should do that in the device module

we can create the firmware files as packages


for the cal data we would like to get it from the device MTD "art"
partition at
boot time.

Found and fixed a bunchg of things that were stopping ath10k from
working. The remaining problem is (I think) that insmod is not
synchronous, so "ip link set up dev wlan1" doesn't work immediately
after the module is inserted. Maybe we need another netlink thing
to wait until the interface is present.


Wed Mar  1 18:26:44 GMT 2023

ath10k works, but the wlan module loading stuff is quite kludgey

I wonder if wlan0, wlan1, eth0, eth1 etc should be defined per-device
- how does the aplication config know which devices exist? If we
decide to switch to some form of persistent device naming, the names
will differ from one device to the next. Perhaps the device should
also provide standard names where possible?

services.network.links = {
  lan = interface { ... };
  wan = interface { ... };
  wlan_24 = interface { ... };
  wlan_5 = interface { ... };
}

Thu Mar  2 22:45:11 GMT 2023

We have a flashable image!

Now we can use the gl-ar750 for internet access in the shed, we can
apppropriate the other device that's in there and try Liminix on it

Fri Mar  3 23:08:58 GMT 2023

If we're going to unplug serial console from the gl-ar750 maybe we
should install an ssh server first.

0) set a root password
1) allow setting a root password from configuration.nix
(means defining config.users properly)
2) allow authorizedKeys per user
3) dropbear service
4) see if the wired lan works! :-)


Sat Mar  4 12:31:07 GMT 2023

To improve logging, each service should have its own s6-log service
which prefixes the service name onto the log line and then sends to
stdout

  https://skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html
  https://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html

As far as I can tell, the `log` directory inside the service
directory should itself be a service directory for the s6-log
process that does this

.... hahaha no that doesn't work

s6-rc, for some reason, ignores the `log` directory and requires
that loggers be done with consumer-for and producer-for instead


Sat Mar  4 23:27:00 GMT 2023

notes for this week's news update

* ath10k kernel support and and firmware

- 5GHz wifi works

- need to retrieve the firmware from a special - partition on the
  device itself, so we do that using a service that - the wlan
  interface depends on

* replace waitup with more generally useful ifwait

to make the ath10k load at boot, we need to insert the module and then
wait for it to do something or other in the background before we can
configure the interface. so we need something like waitup but
for presence not operational state

it turns out that a program that just waits for a particular interface
state and then exits is quite simple to add into run scripts and
we don't need all that notification-fd stuff anyway

* move FW_LOADER* config to modules/base

* rejig config a bit.
- device hardware characteristics are now under
  the `hardware` key and include the available network interfaces.
- options for users and groups are now defined a bit more
  specifically than "attrset", making it possible to e.g. set a
  root password
- dts is moved from `boot` to `hardware`


* now producing flashable images, so you can generate a liminix config
and write it to the device instead of having to boot using TFTP and
a serial console every time

* ssh support

* prefix logs with the service name

Sun Mar  5 22:51:21 GMT 2023

Added swconfig: it was a straight copy from nixwrt and hasn't changed
upstream since. But don't need it, because the lan port works fine
without it (I assume both lan ports and the cpu are all connected
untagged)

figure out how to add these to gl-mt300a device config
then extedner.nix can add a bridge

Tue Mar  7 20:13:15 GMT 2023

We need NTP or some other way to get accurate time

[done] Need to add regulatory.db somewhere standard, maybe modules/wlan?

Tue Mar  7 21:43:56 GMT 2023

When we get to phase 2, need to review how network interfaces and
their addresses interplay. It should be possible to have a network
interface and interrogate the addresses associated with it - esp
with ipv6 where there are multiple addresses for the device

This thought prompted by looking at the loopback interface, which is
a bundle of addresses and therefore we can't see what any of them are


Tue Mar  7 22:05:44 GMT 2023

[phase 1]
20) publish the manual using CI
30) document flashing process
31) go through all the unexpected dmesg and triage it
25) ntp or some other accurate time source

[phase 1.5]
26) ssh keys
8) get ipv6 address from pppoe
9) get ipv6 delegation from pppoe and add prefix to lan
10) support dhcp6 in dnsmasq, and advertise prefix on lan
11) firewalling and nat - default deny or zero trust?
7) upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option, move ppp and pppoe derivations into their own files
32) set up iperf and do some performance measurement
35) also we need to check our wireless country code


[phase 2]
3) document services so I can remember how they work. Refer back to Oct 18 for notes that no longer make sense
4) check out restart behaviour of dependent services when depended-on service dies
13) check that references to outputs correspond with declared outputs
33) network interfaces vs the services that manage their addresses
34) write a short guide explaining how to use s6-svc

[phase n]
12) write secrets holder as a service with outputs
16) writable filesystem (ubifs?)
17) overlay with squashfs/ubifs - useful? think about workflows for how this thing is installed

Lunchtime notes on images for real devices, vs ci.nix

* successfully building an image doesn't mean that the image boots
or does anything useful

* don't want to faff with serial wires on every device every time
to test it. so

* ideally, build ram-based images of rotuer, extneder, arhcive in CI
with a watchdog timer that will reboot if it can't see the network

* figure out how to boot into the new image from an ssh connection.  I
assume the challenging bit here is grabbing x MB of contiguous phys
mem after boot: I think we'd have to reserve it at _first_ boot and
then somehow copy into it before rebooting

An easier first goal might be a tool to flash from the shell command line,
but that runs a greater risk of bricking


Fri Mar 10 14:35:40 GMT 2023

programs.busybox = {
  enable = true;
  applets = [... ];
  config = {
  };
}

Fri Mar 10 23:49:04 GMT 2023

Well, we have the backup host config up and running - though haven't
plugged it back into its disk yet.

For task 1 what remains is

1) ntp sync
2) write up the flashing procedure
3) a video?


Sat Mar 11 13:58:20 GMT 2023

================== for video

what is liminix
- nix-based system for creating OS images for routers
- not "nixos on your router"
  - nixos-like module system,
  - musl for libc
  - s6/s6-rc for services
  - entirely cross-compiled

why am i making a video?
- unless you have a suitable spare device to install on,
  and you want to take it apart, it's currently hard to
  take liminix for a spin
- I have these things, so I can give you a tour

let's have a look at how the hardware's hooked up

web site & manual

a config file:
- observe the comments:
  - not going to spend ages on this because it's not in its final form.
  - as we get more configs for more use cases, we will
    get a better feel for what can be abstracted
  - that will come later: work so far has been on the
    hardware support side

to show that it builds, we're going to add a package. otherwise,
everything from this build is probably already cached

build the config

tftpboot on hardware

flash on hardware

show ci

show a qemu target

Mon Mar 13 22:46:46 GMT 2023

1) rsync on arhcive is failing because no nogroup group

  "/nix/store/gfzzl157r8xyp38lpcfxydkiiy6zrs3c-rsync-3.2.6/bin/rsync" "--verbose" "--stats" "--password-file" "/etc/nixos/secrets/arhcive-rsync" "-rltgoDz" "/var/spool/backup" "backup@arhcive.lan::srv/"
@ERROR: invalid gid nogroup
rsync error: error starting client-server protocol (code 5) at main.c(1837) [sender=3.2.6]

2) we can run findfs in a loop until the disk appears

3) still haven't decided how to do ntp but maybe we should just use
the busybox one

4) some way to do upgrades over the wire

- boot with reserved mem and a phram device at 110-128MB even in the
  flashable version

- watchdog timer in kernel

- kexec in kernel

- userland service to feed the dog as long as local network is up
 (may need to start it a couple of minutes after boot, how do we
  do that?)

- can we use flashcp on a phram mtd?

5) maybe setup a vhost for hydra or something

[nix-shell:~/t]$ wget --reject-regex '\?' -D localhost -N -r --exclude-directories=/api --level=2 --convert-links -e robots=off http://localhost:3003/jobset/liminix/build/

is almost a mirror

Tue Mar 14 20:17:35 GMT 2023

- do we have a phram mtd? need config for size and location

- how do we set the boot device
 - for first boot need to boot real flash, use  dtb, ignore bootloader args
 - for kexec, boot phram, specify args somehow (could rewrite dtb)

 => can use same kernel for both if we can give kexec a dtb with
    different params, which seems to be possible

so we need a module for the initial kernel to say
- create phram mtd
- boot from real mtd (will be index + 1)
- enable KEXEC in kernel
- add kexec-tools

and for the kernel we boot into
- most of the above
- except for the boot device
- create an output with objects that kexec(8) can parse

Could be same module for both with different outputs

what do we call this thing? "revertable"

Wed Mar 15 19:11:09 GMT 2023

"revertable" implies mtd support for the rootfs and a ramdisk at
defined location

"tftpboot" implies "revertable", because it will use the same ramdisk


Fri Mar 17 11:44:40 GMT 2023

- patch the kernel kexec code to pass DTB to new kernel unconditionally
- unpatch pernel to pass command line to kexec (breaks DTB passing)
- decide how we specify rootfs. doing it by number is awkward
  - may be phram
  - may be real mtd root
  - may be real mtd root but renumbered becuase phram exists

Wild idea: we could probably get rid of the need for declaring a phram
device in the first kernel, if we can use kexec to copy the squashfs into
physical ram. As far as I can see this is a simple(sic) matter of
specifying it as a segment, but we would have to extend kexec-tools
to do this and it's quite a niche option if we make it do all the
mtd setup.

kexec --dtb=foo.dtb --map-file=squashfs@0x120000


Sat Mar 18 18:02:26 GMT 2023
What if: we added derivations for "apply openwrt changes" as packages,
which could then be called from the kernel derivation's extraPatchPhase?
There could be one for generic and one for each openwrt targetop

Mon Mar 20 18:40:53 GMT 2023

- kexec patch is sent to mailing list, keep an eye for replies
- watchdog
- ntp
- rebuild images for live devices
- can we build a static busybox with flashcp applet and scp it
 to arhcive etc?
- [DONE] install mailman and hyperkitty on myhtic, create mailing list

Tue Mar 21 22:59:54 GMT 2023

I haven't found a way to arm the watchdog before userland runs, which
would be really nice: although there's WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED
and WATCHDOG_OPEN_TIMEOUT it doesn't seem to be sufficient, Maybe
those options work only when the hardware watchdog is already
armed. It might not be completely awful insofar as any failure to
mount root usually results in panic anyway, so provided we start
watching early in boot then there's not a big window for anything
to go wrong

What should the watchdog service do?  Ideally we want something that
"ratchets" : can be started in early boot and signals health as long
as the system is starting up, then once the system is in "steady
state" it stops pinging as soon as any part of that steady state
becomes unhealthy. This feels like a refinement for a much later
phase though.

Maybe the health criteria might be
(sshd and lan services are running) or (time since boot < 120s)

Thu Mar 23 00:11:23 GMT 2023

tftpboot and (kexecboot || flashable) have incompatible DTB-finding
strategies which is painful if you add both modules and then
expect tftp booting to still work

Maybe we could patch the kernel to use some better strategy for when
to use/ignore the bootloader command line: e.g "only if it
contains the string 'liminix'". Could do this by patching
arch/mips/kernel/setup.c bootcmdline_init to

if(strstr(arcs_cmdline, "liminix") == NULL) arcs_cmdline[0] = '\0'
and then defining CONFIG_MIPS_CMDLINE_DTB_EXTEND. The
bootloader command line then needs to specify only the
_additional_ parameters that weren't in the DTB

(later: that turned out to be quite straighforward)

Fri Mar 24 23:45:12 GMT 2023

- add ntp support
- [DONE] expose hydra to internet
- check MAC address weirdness?
- call Task 1 "done"

Sun Mar 26 00:19:15 GMT 2023

Would be nice to have a flash.sh built in outputs.flashable

Sun Mar 26 15:27:14 BST 2023

Let's think about services and modules.

Module
+ can change global config
  * add users, groups etc
  * change kernel config
  * change busybox config
+ well-typed parameters
- is a "singleton": can't have the same module included twice
  with different config. e.g. can't have two hostap modules running on
  different wlan radios.
- can't express dependencies: a depends on b

suppose:

* modules add service functions to the config? then there's no
way to define a service while forgetting to import the module

* we use the lib.types stuff for service function arguments

* maybe we stop naming services.foo for every damn thing

* but remember, s6 services do need unique names


imports = [ ../modules/dhcp4 ];

services.dhcp4 = config.services.udhcp {
  interface = lan.device;
  options = {
    foo = true;
    bar = 42;
  };
  depends = [ services.some_other_thing ];
}

modules/dhcp4 udhcp fn needs to define a type for its argument, then
use something like

  if arg_type.check def.value then res
            else throw "The option value `${showOption loc}' in `${def.file}' is not a ${arg_type.name}.")

(where def comes from I don't know yet)

Tue Mar 28 10:44:40 BST 2023

we should reserve the name "service" for actual instantiated
services. This means we need a name for the functions that
make services. "class", "template", "fn", "maker", "factory"?
And a namespace name so they're not interleaved with real
services, which sort of suggests they are packages

if we want to do services = {
 foo = longrun { ... };
 bar = longrun { ... };
}

without repeating the `name` as an attribute of the longrun,
then longrun can't return a derivation: it has to return some
function that accepts `name` as a parameter.

where services.a depends on services.b, at the time its builder is run
it needs to know what name s6-rc will use for service b

maybe an s6 service definition should be an attrset not a derivation.

maybe this is outside scope for phase 2

Tue Mar 28 13:22:06 BST 2023

Reading nixos/doc/manual/development/building-parts.chapter.md it
suggests to me that we should rename config.outputs to
config.system.outputs. The more general question here is whether it's
good to be augmenting a variable called "config" with all this
generated stuff that is patently not configuration - perhaps putting
it under a "system" key will keep it all in one place

Tue Mar 28 13:32:30 BST 2023

how should we handle filesystem state? e.g. resolvconf service

if a service provides a file at a known global pathname, it can't be
parametrised - it must be a singleton.

Tue Mar 28 20:25:20 BST 2023

wondering if we should swap phases 2 and 3. We can't really address
modules without addressing services, which is phase +n, whereas we
can tackle overlay/ubi whenever

nand flash may have bad blocks
nor flash (supposedly) doesn't

ubi provides erase counts and bad block remapping on top of the mtd
interface. this means we should avoid flashcp of a ubi image straight
onto (nand) mtd as we will lose the erase counts and bad block information
that UBI tracks.

overlayfs works on a filename basis, so might not be very effective :
any change that results in a new store path will mean the entire package
appears in two places. I think it's reasonable to offer squashfs or
ubifs without overlay.

open questions:

1) if uboot doesn't support UBI, we can't boot a kernel on a ubifs
so we need reserved space for the kernel.

- unless we add some padding after the kernel, every new kernel
that's bigger than its predecessor will trash the start of the
ubi space (and wipe out its erase count)
- This suggests we should build more stuff as modules and less as
compiled-in

2) once a device has had a ubi volume created on it, probably we want
to use ubi-aware tools to update that volume in future instead of a
whole new flash, because we wish to preserve erase counts. This means
running ubiformat --image-file=foo.ubi on the device instead of flashcp

we can add a "ubi-flashable" output that creates a .ubi image and
a flashcp image that wraps it, with instructions on which to use.

Fri Mar 31 22:13:54 BST 2023

Error: too small LEB size 3968, minimum is 15360

> This error means that you are trying to mount too small UBI
volume. Probably because your flash is too small? Try to use JFFS2,
then, because it suits small flashes better since it has much lower
space overhead. Indeed, UBIFS stores much more indexing information on
the flash media than JFFS2, so it has much higher overhead. Also, UBI
has some overhead (see here). Thus, if you have a small flash device
(e.g., about 64MiB), it makes sense to consider using JFFS2.


Argh. Oh well,

Sat Apr  1 15:27:39 BST 2023

There's limited value in recreating pseudofiles for jffs2 because
the system is writable - changes made to /bin, /dev etc in config.filesystem
should take effect on a running system.

Can we take inspiration from https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/ ?

in early boot:
 mount ramfs on /
 mount the writeable filesystem on /persist/
 bind mount /persist/nix on /nix
 run script to populate rootfs from pseudofiles

on a router, do we need _anything_ persistent that's outside the store?

 - state for dhcp leases and stuff
 - secrets
 - maybe, files that the user has downloaded

this will probably require initramfs. if just use jffs2 as the rootfs and
don't worry about /persist, we can skip that step.




[ aside: I think we may be putting two busyboxes in the image:
see modules/s6/default.nix s6-init-scripts has buildInputs = [busybox];  ]

Mon Apr  3 18:34:26 BST 2023

suppose
- we boot the system with systemConfig=/nix/store/eeeeee-system
- the early-init script runs /target/$systemConfig/create-root /target
  after mounting /target
- then it runs chroot /target $systemConfig/bin/init "$@"

or maybe we could combine those steps?
or maybe it doesn't matter too much ...

Thu Apr  6 21:25:41 BST 2023

what now?

- put a jffs2 onto some hardware device
  - what do we do with uboot?
  - should we pad the kernel?
  - maybe kernel module support would be good if we're making it
    hard to do kernel updates
- try the nix-copy-closure thing and work out what else we don't know
- [done] detect endian correctly


to ask a different question, what else do we need to dogfood a router?

Sun Apr  9 10:06:08 BST 2023

- rename outputs.flashable to outputs.flashimage
- rename modules/flashable to modules/flashable_ro
- create outputs.flashable in modules/jffs2
- rename modules/jffs2 to modules/flashable_rw
- add enable config to both?
- enable kernel module compilation


Mon Apr 10 23:50:41 BST 2023

- initramfs parses /proc/cmdline to find root fs, might not play
nice with defaulting

- how to build kernel modules

- look at closure size, is it this big because we've broken it
or is jffs2 usually this much bigger than squashfs

- maybe squashfs with overlay might be better if we could
ensure hardlinks?

- maybe there's something like overlayfs but content-addressable?

Sat Apr 15 18:57:46 BST 2023

for the same configuration:

-r--r--r-- 1 root root 6066176 Jan  1  1970 /nix/store/0x271rg45mcjjgbma9wi31h1yd109fpy-frob-squashfs
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 12255232 Jan  1  1970 /nix/store/zx11adagcbzqsnqkyz5kgvr392vhlrpr-make-jffs2

may want to reconsider not using squashfs with overlay

Wed Apr 19 22:22:48 BST 2023

Where next?

Sun Apr 23 18:24:34 BST 2023

- we are down to ~ 11MB image for a barely functional (IPV4) router
  this is by avoiding all dependencies on openssl or gnutls
- rotuer is not recognising when  I set the hostname
- I may have forgotten the root password :-(
- why is hello world 70K unless hardeningDisable?

Fri Apr 28 20:51:52 BST 2023

To do nix-copy-closure we need nix-store, which is a symlink to nix,
which is

-rwxr-xr-x 1 dan users 2.3M Apr 28 21:08 nix

(stripped). This is a lot bigger than, say, a simple script to
loop through the closure of a derivation and copy only the store
folders that don't exist already.

* we'd like to only transmit the packages that aren't already present

* we'd like to use a single ssh connection


S: here is a list of package names
C: these are the names of the packages I want
S: here are the packages

while read $f ; do
  test -d $f || echo $f
end

Tue May  2 21:53:08 BST 2023

1) we have a script that runs on the receiver, which

 - accepts a list of store paths
 - prints the missing store paths
 - runs cpio -i < stdio

2) we need a script for the sender that

 - refs=$(nix-store -q --references $1 && echo end)
 - opens ssh connection
 - print ssh $refs
 - needed= capture result until "end" received
 - find needed | cpio -o  > ssh-connection
 - close connection

3) to have a reasonable hope of testing this we should do it with qemu. It would be nice
if we could connect without faff to the qemu lan interface : either we do this by bringing up
another qemu vm (preferably with the host store shared, otherwise it has to build a mips cross
compiler/libc) or maybe we could do something unholy with ssh ProxyCommand

ssh -o ProxyCommand "socat - UDP4-DATAGRAM:230.0.0.1:1234,sourceport=1234,reuseaddr,ip-add-membership=230.0.0.1:127.0.0.1"



4) we haven't solved garbage collection, though I think "remove everything not in
nix-path-registration" might be what's needed there

Wed May  3 22:01:19 BST 2023

Something weird is going on with qemu net device enumeration: when I
run it interactively I'm getting the access network (mac ending :02)
on eth0 and the lan (mac ending :01) on eth1, and if it's behaving the
same in CI then how come any of the tests work? vanilla-confinguration.nix
definitely assumes lan=eth0

By switching from  -device virtio-net-pci to     -device virtio-net then
I get the desired behaviour back

Sat May  6 18:42:28 BST 2023

Next:

- package min-copy-closure
- see if we can use it on some output to copy the whole system closure
- post-copying symlink munging
- try it on a real device, see if it works for config file updates
- collect-garbage/delete-old-generation


Sun May  7 23:03:03 BST 2023

Shortly after all the work to reduce system closure size last time, I
tried adding the necessary packages to support nix-copy-closure and
saw it start building a complete C++ system with Boost. My fears that
this would lead to quite a large increase in the system size were, it
turned out, entirely founded.

So I wrote my own - or at least, a quite minimal substitute. The core
logic is simple - on the sender, we get the list of required packages,
then we check for the existence of `/nix/store/eeeeeee-foo` for
each of them on the target, and whatever's missing we send across the
link using cpio.

It sounds simple, and it should be simple, and in retrospect it _was_
simple. Along the way I went on a bit of a Qemu networking tangent and
learned quite a lot about the bash `coproc` command

Tue May  9 21:06:53 BST 2023

General direction of my thoughts:

- get a baseline working rotuer system
- prove that min-copy-closure works with it
- refactor the crap out of it
- configurablise the bordervm usb ethernet setup
- when we have a good idea of how/whether min-copy-closure *actually*
 works, declare "writeable filesystem" to be done
- start to get more of a feel for how the services/config hang together

? why does rotuer not have a hostname?

? how can we get a device hooked up to rotuer's lan port that we can
control remotely

Sun May 14 23:25:46 BST 2023

the outputs.systemConfiguration attribute builds a derivation
containing a single file bin/activate

_Presumably_, copying its closure will copy all the things, as
we already use it as the roots for jffs2 creation. However, there
is also a symlink created from /init at jffs2 creation

Mon May 15 21:32:38 BST 2023

Had a neat idea about uing an overlayfs combining jffs2 and ramfs
to do upgrades that would otherwise be larger than the flash.
Could use "overlay merge" from https://github.com/kmxz/overlayfs-tools

Wed May 17 15:18:55 BST 2023

liminix-rebuild doesn't collect garbage (this is a mising feature, not
a bug). We think we can fix this using nix-path-registration: specifically,
by deleting anything not in it.

What we're going to do: build a fresh system image for rotuer, then
dogfood liminix-rebuild until we've succeeded in getting it to
change its hostname

Also wondering if we should drop outputs.default, but maybe not

* systemConfiguration: used for updates
* vmroot: used for qemu
* flashimage: used for flashing
* tftproot: used for dev/test

As long as we're consistently setting the default output to whichever
is the appropriate "full production image" I think we're good.

Wed May 17 22:45:40 BST 2023

Random thought: when we bind mount /target/persist/nix to /target/nix
we could make it read-only. worth doing?

Thu May 18 10:59:39 BST 2023

- liminix-rebuild can't find reboot: probably the PATH is just
  generally wrong for ssh sessions (maybe all non-login sessions?)

- need to copy path registration file somewhere useful and
  delete stuff not in it at the appropriate time. Would be safest
  to do that either late in the shutdown process before rebooting,
  or during boot.

Fri May 19 15:18:13 BST 2023

If we make min-collect-garbage - just a command you can run whenever -
that will be fine for current capabilities.  It won't work with the
theoretical overlayfs system, though: we need to copy-down from the
ramfs to real flash before rebooting, and that can't happen until
there's disk space to do it

Sat May 20 22:35:25 BST 2023

We have a working min-collect-garbage (seems to, anyway ...)

- having ssh host key wiped on reboot is sucky. maybe we can have
/persist/secrets and a service that looks there?

- find out what files ash sources on non-login shell startup
  [ set ENV=/etc/ashrc in parent process env ]

- services.default is suboptimal as there is no way to add to it
without wiping it

- decide whether to use liminix- or min- as our prefix for nixy
  commands

- should we move config.outputs  -> config.system.outputs ? see Mar 28

- less crap firewall

- add ipv6 support to rotuer

- create an l2tp configuration

- iperf and tuning

- wlan country code


dropbear weak hashes? https://github.com/mkj/dropbear/issues/138

Sun May 21 11:48:07 BST 2023

dropbear will generate host keys on first connection. It's (probably) good that the
key is generated on-device and also that we wait until there's some randomness.
It's not so good that it will only write the key to DSS_PRIV_FILENAME which is
hardcoded to /run

Sun May 21 17:27:31 BST 2023

What do we need for ipv6?

-  upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option, move ppp and pppoe derivations into their own files
-  get ipv6 address from pppoe
-  get ipv6 delegation from DHCPv6
-  support dhcp6 in dnsmasq, and advertise prefix on lan
-  firewall settings

Sun May 21 21:30:17 BST 2023

Making hydra build the docs is straightforward, but making it
_publish_ the docs is outside scope, really. It can serve the files
but they're all text/plain

Should hydra push the docs to www.liminix.org or should www.liminix.org
pull?

TODO-at-some-point: assign uids and gids dynamically, somehow

Tue May 30 21:25:37 BST 2023

We have an odhcpc script that preserves the prefix delegation from the
ISP.  We need a service that notices whenever the state is
available/has changed, and updates the LAN IPv6 address.

The service can depend on odhcp

add inotify to packages
use writeFennelScript with that dep
see if it works

Wed May 31 23:33:00 BST 2023

We have a thing that sets ipv6 address on lan interface, yay us

A firewall would be a very good idea

Thu Jun  1 18:46:59 BST 2023

TODO for now:

- services.default is suboptimal as there is no way to add to it
without wiping it

- decide whether to use liminix- or min- as our prefix for nixy
  commands

- should we move config.outputs  -> config.system.outputs ? see Mar 28

- less crap firewall

- create an l2tp configuration

- iperf and tuning

- wlan country code

Thu Jun  1 21:26:37 BST 2023

how can a client machine "opt out" of using the firewall, to allow
incoming connections?  Most convenient would be to have a separate SSID
for grownups. Assuming it shows up as a separate wlan device, we can
write firewall rules to allow incoming connections on that interface
(can we? only if the packet is identifiable as destined for that interface)

https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6092.html
https://emailstuff.org/rfc/rfc7084

We could block incoming for slaac and dhcp addresses and permit it for
stable private addresses. If we were fairly sure that devices won't
ask for stable private addresses just for funsies.

I found a handy guide to nftables at https://ww.telent.net/2023/6/2/turning_the_nftables

Mon Jun  5 16:56:44 BST 2023


How are we going to do this firewall thing then?
I can see no reason to have more than one table per family, so lets
just name the tables after families

There is nothing in nftables for functionally grouping rules by
requirement that may touch multiple hooks/chains, so we need our own
abstraction - and we can't call it any name that nftables uses already
(so, not "ruleset"). rulegroup?

"policy" would be a good name except that it's already taken

"concern"? "requirement"? "feature"?

Mon Jun 19 20:45:48 BST 2023

why is chrony using libedit?

Thu Jun 22 09:52:57 BST 2023

- There is a lot more lua being installed (luac, docs, static
  libraries etc) than we really need.

- update User docs to include a list of supported  targets

Thu Jun 22 23:43:06 BST 2023

- is there a sysfs to enable ipv6 forwarding?
- we haven't an ipv4 firewall yet

Thu Jun 22 23:58:58 BST 2023

Looks like we're missing at least one kernel config setting for
nftables. Would this be a good time to do a derivation for building
kernel modules?


Sun Jul  9 21:21:17 BST 2023


Tue Jul 11 22:10:17 BST 2023

- s6 cheatsheet, find or write
- could we have > 1 module add to services.default?
- odhcp should parse values from environ and write more files, to save readers
 from parsing it
- pkgs.liminix, who knows what thats for any more?
- interface.device, as a  general rule, doesn't work because the
  device name may be known only at runtime (e.g. for ppp)
- iperf
- figure out wifi regdomain

Tue Jul 11 23:01:59 BST 2023

We can make services depend on kernel modules, however not on bakedin
kernel config

[from March: "Let's think about services and modules."]

Module
+ can change global config
  * add users, groups etc
  * change kernel config
  * change busybox config
+ well-typed parameters
- is a "singleton": can't have the same module included twice
  with different config. e.g. can't have two hostap modules running on
  different wlan radios.
- can't express dependencies: a depends on b

thought I had then was: modules provide services. requiring the
ppp module causes config.services.ppp to exist, so you can

services.default = [
  (config.services.ppp {
    tty = "17";
    baud = "57600";
    secrets = blah;
    })
  ...
]

this might work. also though we should find out how to do type checking on
service params

Wed Jul 12 23:23:02 BST 2023

https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/406 // why mobile nixos uses
mobile.outputs instead of system.build

  suggests that system.build may not be a thing to blindly emulate

if a service is a derivation should we expect to want to be able to call
it with .override? maybe we want to override the package containing the
daemon it runs. How do we best pass service config as well?

Maybe a service template is a function that returns a derivation


imports = [ ./modules/pqmud.nix ];
services.mud = system.services.pqmud {
  realm = "A deep cavern";
  port = 4067;
  users = import ./allowed-users.nix;
  # etc etc
};
services.mudBeta = let mud =
  system.services.pqmud {
    realm = "A very deep cavern";
    port = 4068;
    users = import ./allowed-users.nix;
  };
  in mud.overrideAttrs { pqmud = pkgs.pkmudLatest; };

so we have

config.system.services # services provided by modules
config.system.outputs  # build artefacts of various types

the services provided by a module must be introspectable in some way
so that we can compile a list of service options per module

service parameters are defined using the module type system.
Something like this?

# mud.nix

system.services.pqmud = args :
  let t = {
    name = mkOption { type = types.str; };
    realm = mkOption { type = types.str; };
    port = mkOption { type = types.port; default = 12345; };
    users = mkOption { type = types.any; };
  };
  in assert isType (submodule { options = t; }) args; longrun {
     inherit (args) name;
     run = "${pkgs.pqmud}/bin/pqmud --port ${port} ....."
  };

Fri Jul 14 19:07:59 BST 2023

It works for pppoe, though typechecking error messages could be
better.

- We need to find a good place to keep the typeCheck function so that
everyone can use it.

- also the type_service type defn exists only locally in modules.nix,
and we would like to refer to it elsewhere

Thu Aug 10 21:46:36 BST 2023

to finish service/modules milestone

[done] there are some modules not using serviceDefn
- modules included by standard.nix should have all their options
  grouped together in docs
  how can we determine which they are? or maybe "modules that
   don't contain services" is an acceptable criterion
  maybe this is not actually an issue, if the modules are
   reasonably coherent. It looks odd now because base.nix is a mess
[done] print the module pathname so people know what to import
[done] docs don't print the examples
[check?] and seem to be getting the default wrong too
- decide what we deem to be "internal" (if anything)
   is `filesystem` internal, for example? or `busybox`? they're
   both mostly _used_ internally but may still be valuable to expose
[done] maybe document outputs separately or not at all?
[done] bridge to be one service instead of two?
[done] get rid of services/
- anything else in rotuer.nix that we should servicify
- services for liminix.networking
- a nice way to specify service dependencies
[done] - do another video

Mon Aug 21 20:02:55 BST 2023

a nice way to do dependencies would be somethng like

services.thething =
  let s = svc.thing { .... };
  in addDependencies s (with config.services; [otherthing yetanother]);

except that addDependencies is a really klunky name. dependsOn is very
slightly better? or maybe it could be a function of the derivation?

services.thething =
  svc.thing { .... }.depends (with config.services; [otherthing yetanother]);

---

what does it mean to be dependent on an interface? that's it up? running?
has an address? has a collection of addresses?


  services.defaultroute4 = route {
    name = "defaultroute4";
    via = "$(output ${services.wan} address)";
    target = "default";
    dependencies = [ services.wan ];
  };

- this route requires the interface to have an address (if wan is an
  interface, anyway ...)

- but otoh a dhcp client doesn't want to wait for an address, because
   it is assigning the address.

should an address provider have "interface name" as an output?
is there a set of outputs that every address provider should have -
whether static, dhcp, pppoe?

maybe we're in decision paralysis and should just move forward with
what we know

Wed Aug 23 18:56:08 BST 2023

We may want to change the hardware device files to specify network
interface names not services. Otherwise hardware devices (boards)
depend on module-based-services, which is a bit weird.

Thu Aug 24 18:54:03 BST 2023

- we want network and bridge to be separate modules, because bridge
introduces extra kernel config

- bridge/service wants to create a network device ("ip link"),
using quite similar code as network/link.nix

- but bridge/service is a derivation: it has sight of pkgs but not
config

offtopic: useful s6-rc commands at https://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/faq.html

Fri Aug 25 23:37:57 BST 2023

where we left off: bridge is a bundle, and bundles can't have outputs,
so how do we set the ifname of the bridge?

- ifname of the primary is set
- actually, most things that depend on the bridge really just depend
  on the primary anyway (it's OK if 1 <= n < #members are down)
- but *something* should depeond on all the members

turns out maybe we needed two services after all?

Sun Aug 27 23:50:18 BST 2023

I've done enough to make rotuer build, but in the process
trashed vanilla-configuration as I entirely forgot we don't have

- and arhcive (rsync, watchdog)
- services for liminix.networking

Sat Sep  2 21:35:41 BST 2023

Considerations for "mount" service: each filesystem needs to depend on
any mount points for its parent directories, and maybe also on other
services (e.g. filesystem modules, network devices, routes)

mountpoints = {
 mnt = {
   media = svc.mountpoint.build {
     fstype = "msdos";
     device = "/dev/sda1";
     options = [ ...];
   };
   archive = svc.mountpoint.build {
     fstype = "ext4";
     device = "/dev/sda2";
     options = [ ...];
     mountpoints = {
       remote = svc.mountpoint.build {
         fstype = "nfs";
	 device = "doc.ic.ac.uk:/public";
       };
     };
   };
  };
}

services.somethingelse = svc.ftpd.build {
  # ...
  dependencies = [ mountpoints.mnt.archive ];
}

what don't we like about this? we have to walk the nested attrset in a
weird way, because the services may contain other mountpoints. Maybe
just keep it simple and do


services.mountpoints = bundle {
 name = "mountpoints";
 contents = [
   svc.mountpoint.build {
     device = "/dev/sda2"; fstype = "ext4"; directory = "/mnt/isos";
   };
   svc.mountpoint.build {
     device = "/dev/sdb1"; fstype = "msdos"; directory = "/mnt/backup";
     dependencies = [ load-vfat-module ];
   };
 ];
}

how to dogfood

DHCP6 server: static lease support
DHCP client and acquire-{lan-prefix,wan-address}

The emergency boot thingy in glinet u-boot won't help because it
expects to flash from its tftp request instead of booting it. So we
could use kexec instead except that the openwrt install doesn't have
it.  So we could swap the hardware devices, the only downside of that
being that then I don't have a test system any more. Or we could YOLO it.

Sun Sep  3 22:11:02 BST 2023

I think we should rejigger the documentation ...

- "getting started": worked example, building and installing Liminix
with a very simple config (wifi AP with ssh daemon)

- using modules
  - link to module reference

- creating custom services
  - longrun or oneshot
  - dependencies
  - outputs

- creating your own modules

- hacking on Liminix itself

- contributing

- external links and resources

- module reference

- hardware device reference

---

I think we might rename wlan_24 to wlan and wlan_5 to wlan1.
This is on the assumption that almost no device is 5GHz only, so
would make it easier to write a basic wlan example that works
both on 2.4GHz boards and dual radio boards

Mon Sep  4 23:15:26 BST 2023

If dhcpcd parsed the update-script output into separate files, half
the complexity of acquire-lan-prefix would go away. The other half is
because it subscribes to changes in the outputs instead of just
running once. Perhaps there's a better way to do that?

Could separate prefixes and addresses something like this...

outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:40dc\:\:/prefix
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:40dc\:\:/length
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:40dc\:\:/preferred
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:40dc\:\:/valid
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:80\:\:/prefix
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:80\:\:/length
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:80\:\:/preferred
outputs/prefix/2001\:8b0\:de3a\:80\:\:/valid

the directory name is arbitrary as long as it's unique. Might even be better to
remove the colons

outputs/prefix/200108b0de3a40dc/valid

or we could adopt the MS convention and replace with hyphens

outputs/prefix/2001-8b0-de3a-40dc--/prefix

Also: we should write some kind of test for this...

How do we set the cpu governor?


Fri Sep  8 21:26:36 BST 2023

We want a fennel thing that reads a filesystem tree into a nested
table. And a thing to diff two tables

Sat Sep  9 22:40:50 BST 2023

Subscribers to odhcp6c outputs need to be able to tell which addresses
are new and which have been removed since the last run, which now we
have ohdcp-script  producing parsed data means they need to compare
tables by value. Which is a faff.

What if the directory name were a hash of all the relevant fields
such that clients could just say "new directory, must be new address"

We can have literal prefix, then need to encode
length,preferred,valid,extra space-efficiently. I cannot currently see
any way to use whatever hashing Lua uses for its table lookups,
which is a bit disapppointing, so we might have to make our own


https://gist.github.com/scheler/26a942d34fb5576a68c111b05ac3fabe
this is DJBHash, though doesn't appear to deal with integer overflow


function hash(str)
    h = 5381;

    for c in str:gmatch"." do
        h = ((h << 5) + h) + string.byte(c)
    end
    return h
end

acquire-lan/wan-foo have no tests, and the test setup is a bit of a
faff as they are both waiting on the filesystem

also, testing lua scripts is a faff without splitting them into
script/module

am wondering if we could do some kind of convention that we only write
modules not scripts but something in the fennel->lua can call the
module's `run` method.

Tuesday

Here is a working shebang for write-fennel:

#!/nix/store/5iwv3h2jjbk2vib2bpwx3g9knpb02x3y-lua-5.3.6/bin/lua -e dofile(arg[0]).run()

Tue Sep 12 20:47:52 BST 2023

We don't handle unbound or stopped states in odhcp consumers. I think
probably we should do this in odhcp-script by deleting the outputs,
rather than making each consumer do it.

... turns out that odhcp6c itself unsets ADDRESSES and PREFIXES before
calling the script with "unbound", so maybe we don't need to do
anything special.

TODO

- service for dhcp6 client
- move acquire-{wan,lan} scripts out of examples/
- service for resolvconf
- nftables syntax error
- tidy up the dependency handling in serviceDefn build
   (interface is fine, implementation is a bit brutal)
- docs

considerations:

1) in some ways, we should be able to specify acquire-{wan,lan} as if
they were just additional addresses on the respective
interfaces. However, they're longruns so the implementation of
"address" doesn't really fit.

2) should they be bundled into a dhcp client service? I think the
answer is "no" because which of the dhcp config we want to
honour locally (and how) is policy not mechainmsm

svc.dhcp6c.client.build { interface = wan; };
svc.dhcp6c.address.build {
  inherit client;
  interface = lan;
};
svc.dhcp6c.address.build {
  inherit client;
  interface = wan;
};
svc.dhcp6c.prefix.build {
  inherit client;
  interface = lan;
  index = 1;			# default to first interface
};
svc.dhcp6c.prefix.build {
  inherit client;
  interface = vpn;
  index = 2;
};

Qemu worked example provides dhcp and ssh service

Hardware worked example needs to be plugged into same lan as build
machine if we are going to tftp the image onto it - so it might be
awkward if we run dhcp on it

The device I have lying around is the A

How do we do the actual flash step? Assuming the device is running
stock firmware, from a laptop we can wifi to it and use the web ui to
upgrade

we can't build the hellonet config because it requires tftp

plug in mt300a
put stock firmware on it

Sun Sep 17 00:08:03 BST 2023

I don't think the user manual needs a full justification of why we
have the module/service split. Maybe we should have "decision records"
in the git tree instead

Sun Sep 17 16:44:31 BST 2023

Can we figure out which bits of the old doc are missing from the new
one and just transplant those? Then we can merge it sooner
instead of blocking on writig all the new stuff

No, that wasn't it. Turned out to be an endianness-dependent check for
JFFS2 magic in mtdsplit.

We have a bootable aarch64 kernel for the Belkin, but it does not
understand the memmap= parameter we're using to protect the
phram image from being used as general memory.

One option is to add a reserved-memory stanza in the device tree,
using u-boot "fdt" command, but we don't know the fdt address in u-boot
because it doesn't have any commands to parse the image and set
variables pointing at the sub-components. (There's iminfo, but it's
onyl human-readable)

Second option is to amend the dtb in the tftpboot module: this
would mean regenerating the uimage

Third option: for tftpboot do we _have_ to use FIT? maybe we could
grab the fdt as a separate tftp transaction

we need to apply kernel patch 9401911f2d9f89035f7acebab16e72d43d1282fb
to avoid using ioremap on sysem ram which is not allowed on arm


Tue Oct  3 14:15:38 BST 2023

Progress on Liminix ARM support. The device I'm starting with is
the Belkin RT3200 (also known as [Linksys E8450](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e8450)) which seems to be a featureful piece of kit, and whioch I snagged for a
very good price on the Bay of E

# Where are we right now?

* we can TFTP boot it to userland
* ethernet works

## What else needs doing?

* it has dual band wifi with many interesting features. I've built the

* we're only running in RAM, probably need to add some kernel config
  to support the flash
* initramfs support is not yet implemented
* the flash is NAND flash and it's quite large compared with the
  existing Liminix devices, so we're going to add UBIFS which will
  use it better than  JFFS2 does
* all this work is on a branch and needs to be cleaned up a lot before
   I'm letting it into main

## What have we found?

There are some significant differences between this and the MIPS
devices (yes, other than an entirely different architecture), mostly
to do with "legacy boot" support or the lack thereof. For example:

* there aren't any options like `MIPS_RAW_APPENDED_DTB` to glom
  together a kernel and device tree (FDT), because the bootloader is
  expected to be able to provide a FDT following "standards".
  U-Boot will do this, provided that we use the newer "FIT" Uimage
  format which allows a kernel and DTB and initrd to be combined in
  the same container.  (Sadly we can't use FIT everywhere because a
  lot of MIPS devices use really old forks of U-Boot that don't
  understand it)

* for tftpboot, on MIPS we use the `memmap` kernel command line option
  to reserve some RAM for the root filesystem. On Arm there's no such
  option, so we have to add a
  [reserved-memory](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.yaml)
  node in the device tree instead. Which means, given that we _only_
  want to do this when tftp booting (the memory is wasted
  otherwise), we have to rewrite the device tree in that
  scenario.

* then it turns out that phram doesn't (didn't) work anyway, because
  it calls ioremap() and [you can't use ioremap on system memory on ARM](https://lwn.net/Articles/409689/). In newer kernels this is
  fixed: there is a [conditional](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/mtd/devices/phram.c#L127) here to use whichever of ioremap or
  memremap is appropriate for the memory passed to phram, but it looks
  non-trivial to backport so I've gone for a [much less sophisticated approach](https://gti.telent.net/dan/liminix/commit/f7cd9c2b6e6c99a228e066b09e3febcf71c63fa1#diff-d8e355f1b2dcde7378ebb40c92cdd2ce3125753c)

* we're using [DSA](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/dsa/dsa.txt) instead of the OpenWrt [swconfig](https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/swconfig) program. There was actually surprisingly little work needed to adjust to this.


Other than that, it was mostly the usual process of "did the kernel
crash silently, or has it just been unable to open a console device?".
In this regard, *one neat trick*: even though U-Boot on this device
doesn't support pstore, we can use it anyway if we don't do compression.
Enable

```
        PSTORE = "y";
        PSTORE_RAM = "y";
        PSTORE_CONSOLE = "y";
        PSTORE_DEFLATE_COMPRESS = "n";
```

then boot with `panic=3 oops=panic`, then when it resets use the
U_Boot `md` command to see what happened:

By randomly including chinks of the openwrt config we have made it
find the mt7915e on the pcie bus. I just don't yet know which bit of
the openwrt config it was.

It doesn't actually work yet though. 5GHz wifi gets calibration data
from the flash, so it is not going to work unless (1) we reflash the
firmware partition, or (2) we find another way to provide it
calibration data.

We're almost ready to merge the rt3200 support (it's not finished
but it mostly won't break mips) except for the uimage module
which needs all that FIT stuff, and the tftpboot contortions
to amend the dtb for memmap

For legacy uimage

1) add commandline params to dtb
2) objcopy fdt into vmlinux.elf
3) strip to raw image and compress
4) mkimage


For FIT uimage

1) add commandline params to dtb
2) strip to raw image and compress
3) create its file
4) mkimage

Do we still want to handle the no-dtb case? what about
standards-compliant boot, where u-boot is providing the dtb? No option
to provide a commandline in that case, but maybe also no need to.

For tftpboot, am undecided. We could use the dtb rewriting thing
everywhere, in the interest of consistency.

Mon Oct  9 20:45:54 BST 2023

we bumped the kernel entry point to the 32MB mark, as

(1) when using jffs2 (big rootfs image) it was clobbering the dtb at
the end of the filesystem

(2) it should be 2MB aligned anyway and wasn't

However, this has given us the next problem:

OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory for node 'secmon@43000000': base 0x00000000430B
OF: reserved mem: OVERLAP DETECTED!
phram-rootfs (0x0000000040400000--0x0000000053a31488) overlaps with ramoops@42ff0000 (0x000000004)
Zone ranges:
  DMA      [mem 0x0000000040000000-0x000000005fffffff]
  DMA32    empty
  Normal   empty
Movable zone start for each node

the end of that phram-rootfs region looks well sus.

[ turns out that decimal is not hex ]

UBI bleurgh ...

we made a volume using "ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N liminix -S 825"

and from ubinfo -a we can see

0 ubootenv
1 ubootenv2
2 recovery
3 boot_backup
4 liminix

Now we could use "ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_4 /path/to/ubifs.img"
to put a ubifs on that volume, but obviously we'd have to boot the
device into Liminix somehow first.

Alternatively in the build environment we could use ubinize to
create the entire image that can be flashed to MTD, but

- this will overwrite erase counters.
- we have to give it a config file that describes all the volumes,
 and I'm guessing they need to match up with the existing ones
 otherwise we trash the uboot env


Wed Oct 11 17:37:09 BST 2023

We can write ubi volumes from u-boot.  Let's for the moment use
mkfs.ubifs and tftp those files to u-boot - we can figure out the
ubinize dance later

We need either

(a) to write an analogue of our jffs2 graft option for mkfs.ubifs, or
(b) to have a "cpio-like" mkfs.ubifs variant that reads filenames on stdin
  and writes only those, or
(c) to create a "staging" directory during build with all the store folders that need to go into the filesystem

although the least elegant, option (c) is the simplest and probably
not even slow, at least by comparison with unpacking the kernel source
tarball

we used
uboot> tftpboot 0x40400000 result/rootfs
uboot> ubi write 40400000 liminix $filesize

then can use ubifsmount ubi0:liminix ; ubifsls / to check that it wrote
something valid. To boot this:

setenv serverip 10.0.0.1
setenv ipaddr 10.0.0.8
setenv bootargs 'liminix console=ttyS0,115200 panic=10 oops=panic init=/bin/init loglevel=8 root=ubi0:liminix  rootfstype=ubifs fw_devlink=off'
tftpboot 0x4007ff28 result/uimage
bootm 0x4007ff28

The other thing we had to fix here is that activate wasn't being built
statically. Have to add -Xlinker -static to CFLAGS - I don't know if
this is a no-op on MIPS

Mon Oct 16 20:51:08 BST 2023

Here's a thing: the u-boot installed by openwrt on this device has a
ubifsload command, and it has a writable ubootenv. So instead of
having a separate partition for the kernel we could put the kernel in
the actual filesystem

I think we should do this by excluding flashimage and including some
other module (to be written) instead. ubimage or somesuch, perhaps.

So the image we wish to create is a ubifs with a kernel inside it in
/boot and we also need to change the u-boot env value of

boot_production=led $bootled_pwr on ; run ubi_read_production && bootm $loadaddr#$bootconf ; led $bootled_pwr off

so that it mounts the rootfs and finds /boot/uimage inside it

From uboot this is setenv and saveenv; from a running linux this is fw_setenv

setenv bootargs 'liminix console=ttyS0,115200 panic=10 oops=panic init=/bin/init loglevel=8 root=ubi0:liminix  rootfstype=ubifs fw_devlink=off'


ubifsmount ubi0:liminix
ubifsload 4007ff28 boot/uimage
bootm 0x4007ff28


Thu Oct 19 23:11:17 BST 2023

Assuming you've done the openwrt installer to repartion the device,
what are the steps to install Liminix?

1) build rootfs, which incorporates kernel

2) from u-boot:

uboot> ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N liminix -S 825
uboot> tftpboot 0x40400000 result/rootfs
uboot> ubi write 40400000 liminix $filesize
uboot> setenv boot_production 'led $bootled_pwr on ; ubifsmount ubi0:liminix; ubifsload 4007ff28 boot/uimage; bootm 4007ff28'

What if we don't have a serial console? can we do all this from openwrt?

Open questions

1) using -device loader for qemu phram, how do we choose appropriate
start address for all architectures? we could try to unify this
with the tftpboot approach, but that would mean providing the dtb
ourselves somehow which seems silly when qemu already does it

2) flash erase block size for tftpboot phram, it need to match the hardware
 - we don't use it at all for squashfs
 - for jffs2 it needs to match if tftpboot is to use same rootfs image
   as flash
 - we don't have any way to do a tftpboot ubifs
 - ext4 doesn't care

3) the rootfstype needs thought.

- for all but squashfs it implies an initramfs
- jffs2 can be flashed naively
- ubifs needs an installer to not clobber erase counts
- ext4 (for omnia) needs a block device and can't be flashed along
  with the kernel/initramfs because it's a separate disk. or maybe
  the omnia can load kernel from mmc?

phram plus mtd_block is ok for ext4 for qemu, so that's one thing
fewer to deal with

4) for tftpboot with a separate initramfs, is there any way to
make address selection easier?

5) ubifs needs a different set of flash parameters (PEB, LEB etc)

Tue Nov  7 23:19:10 GMT 2023

We can flash the turris omnia from a USB stick
https://docs.turris.cz/hw/omnia/rescue-modes/

it looks for omnia-medkit-latest.tar.gz and (I'm guessing) just
unpacks it onto the emmc.

Perhaps we need per-device installation instructions in the docs.

* rename defaultOutput to installerOutput
* attach some docs to the various options for installerOutput
* add a link from the device's rendered manual section to the
 relevant installer output doc

do we expect that outputs will build on each other? e.g.
turris omnia output is basically a tarball (other devices
might want this too) but with docs describing how to reset the
device and hold the button down until the led flashes four times
(other devices probably won't want this). maybe the model here
is that the turris output is a directory with a symlink to the
tarball and an informative README containing the instructions.
Although we also want the instructions in the manual where people
can read them before building anything.

Fri Nov 10 21:27:50 GMT 2023

Realising now that outputs and installers aren't the same thing.

e.g. flashimage can be installed from u-boot or from kexecboot

perhaps we distinguish between the

"installation image":
- firmware.bin
- tarball
- ubifs image
- kernel + rootfs

and "installer"
- kexecboot script
- u-boot script to flash squashfs image

Sun Nov 12 17:17:30 GMT 2023

What TODO?

- "does the kernel live on the filesystem" depends on the bootloader
  not the filesystem
   - could we implement this with a module that adds to config.filesystem ?
     it would depend on whether the bootloader can follow symlinks to
     files not in /boot (probably fine unless crossing filesystems)
   - the other question is how much futzing around in u-boot can/do we do
     to tell u-boot how to boot? for grown-up u-boot it's not a
     problem as we can saveenv but are there broken u-boots that would
     prevent this?

- kexecboot is unloved and documented in the wrong place. do we have a
  test for it even?
   - it won't work on aarch64 because it needs memmap=
   - hardcodes memory size, which we should probably work out dynamically

- how to put device name into the device docs
  maybe devices

- make config.boot.commandLine a single string
- finish omnia
- for installation on turris omnia we need tarball not ext4 image
  (but keep the ext4 image anyway for tftpboot and possibly kexecboot)
[done] - now we have lim.parseInt should we use it consistently?
- usefulness tiers for devices ("stable", "experimental", "wip")
- params for ubi(fs) are a mess
- create an l2tp configuration
- iperf and tuning
- wlan country code


Fri Nov 17 17:30:39 GMT 2023

kexec is fraught. I spent some time trying (unsuccesfully) to get a
kexecboot test running, but it doesn't work in qemu for the reason
that the kernel I built for qemu has SMP support but does not have
kexec_nonboot_cpu_func() - which is the needed function to stop
non-boot CPUs before jumping into the new kernel.  That this code is
all MIPS-specific (I have to assume that other architectures have
entirely different ways to stop non-boot CPUs?) is a bit worrisome: how
many other ways is kexec hardware-dependent?

We have two scenarios where we may want to use it:

1) the "installer": e.g. for UBI platforms, we want to plonk
a new ubifs on the device without clobbering the erase counters, which
means either doing it from U-Boot - needs serial connection -
or doing it from a Linux of some kind that is not running on the
filesystem we're toasting.

2) reinstalling after the initial install - this is a big deal for
squashfs where there is no other way to change data, and an only slightly
smaller deal for jffs2, where there isn't much room to change much
data.

Maybe instead of kexec we could do this by stopping services and then
pivot_root into a ramfs. We would, I assume, need to stop any processes
that have open files on the root fs, but we would need to have network
interfaces running. So we need a subset of services that run in recovery:
can make this a bundle

* mount a ramfs
* copy the closure of the bundle into the ramfs
* stop all processes (including init?)

sending pid 1 a signal FOO will cause it to run .s6-svscan/SIGFOO

Fri Nov 17 23:53:43 GMT 2023

  chroot .
  exec /bin/init -D maintenance

foreground {

Thu Nov 23 00:09:44 GMT 2023

I was as surprised as anybody that this seems to work, at least
insofar as it has started a busybox sh process. there is a serious
deficit of symlinks to busybox, so almost no shell scripts work. and I
think we need an rc.init

It would be worth tidying up the main s6 run-image quite a lot before
we go further with this

We'd like to be able to reuse the s6 pseudofile structure (/etc/s6-rc
and /etc/s6-linux-init) but we can't make it a derivation because it's
pseudofiles (with funny permissions) not real files. Maybe we can
invoke the module as a function?

   support for that as well?)

- [DONE] feed the watchdog
   it looks like compiling watchdog support is sufficient to stop the
   thing from rebooting after three minutes, there is no need to actually
   feed it from userspace.

Sun Nov 26 15:37:07 GMT 2023

hatching a plan ... we could do "predictable" network interfaces like this:

 . add a devpath attr to network/link.nix
 . get the kernel-issued name from "/sys${devpath}/net"
 . use ip link set ${oldname} name ${newname}

if we had the full iproute2 thng we could keep the old name as well:
# ip link property add dev wan altname eth1

maybe we could do this with lua/netlink? no support in there currently
for RTM_NEWLINKPROP though

Maybe we'll skip doing the altname. The attraction of it is that it
means the existing name isn't removed, so there's no possibility of a
race.

The kernel will allocate eth0 when asked for eth%d and there is no
eth0. This might be the case where eth0 previously existed but it
just got renamed to lan

Sun Nov 26 21:20:23 GMT 2023

The wrinkle here is ifwait: using netlink we can't wait for an
interface by devpath but have to do it by name - which is a problem if
the interface is not yet present, because there won't be a devpath
in which to look up the name until it is.

So we need a new flow

 - wait for devpath to exist
 - get the ifindex (which shouldn't change, even if the name does)
 - churn rtnetlink messages for that index

We don't want to poll the sysfs file, but we can check it whenever
we get a netlink message

Sun Nov 26 22:33:16 GMT 2023

There is no way to refer to the hardware device for a bridge interface
by sysfs path because it has none. This is probably true of other
virtual devices as well.

ls: cannot access '/sys/class/net/vbridge0/device': No such file or directory

Also, there is no way to refer to the _netdevice_ of a hardware
interface without also knowing its default name, which doesn't help us
if enumeration changes

ls /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/net/
enp1s0

So we should only be specifying devices by devpath if they're
hardware devices discovered by the kernel, not synthetic devices (that
we pick the name of anyway).

So maybe we don't need to rewrite ifwait, we just do it after renaming
the device

Wed Nov 29 21:28:37 GMT 2023

How do we name outputs?

fileystem image
with-boot filesystem image (e.g. ubifs for belkin)
tarball
with-boot tarball (e.g. omnia)
flashable combined image of kernel + filesystem (e.g. gl-mt*)
kernel + filesystem image + dtb + tftpboot glue
kernel + filesystem image + qemu script

we could add initramfs as a separate thing for tftpboot and qemu
(and FIT images) but it would mean not sharing a kernel with
the outputs that require embedded initramfs

we can enable with-boot variants of outputs by adding a
boot.loader config option. if we go that route, can we
use config options to drive the whole output thingy?
We could have a config option that just changes "defaultOutput"
but is that useful?

Maybe the question is: we can choose a different output at build time
rather than editing configuration - how often is this useful? I think
tftpboot vs installable is about the only case.

adding a /boot to a filesystem differs from making a combined
flashable image because it is a config change and not a composition
of two other already-built outputs.

we could have done tftpboot that way as well, but we chose to unpack
and repack the fdt so we don't have to build two kernels - and also so
that we can have both outputs from the same configuration without
editing any files.

for tftpboot we don't want to make the filesystem embed the kernel
if we need a separate kernel for booting (guessing we can't usually make
u-boot loopback mount a downloaded filesystem image). so that points to
not making it a config option,  _or_ to making the inclusion logic
(hardware wants a kernel in filesystem) && !(output == tftpboot)
which itself means the output somehow needs to be injected into the
config

nix-build  -I liminix-config=./examples/hello-from-mt300.nix  --arg device "import ./devices/my-device" --arg output=tftpboot

let's see if we can not do that?

repacking a ubifs to add /boot is awkward and unpleasant

Thu Nov 30 14:33:08 GMT 2023

~~We need a new boot-in-rootfs output which calls rootfs with
(config.filesystem  // { /boot ... }) when the device
boot type is extlinux~~

~~Do we need to put it in systemConfiguration as well? Yes,
otherwise liminix-rebuild won't install it~~

We may have a problem here actually: if /boot is only set up after
reboot, by adding a link while running the initramfs, how did the
bootloader  find the kernel to boot in the first place? So
we need /boot to exist and to point to the new kernel before rebooting
into it, so we need to create it as a real directory along with /nix/store
when making the filesystem,
instead of relying on activate which will be too late.

maybe we could extract the root directory structure creation
as a separate output from rootfs, then there is a single place
to put "and also add /boot"

we will need to update pkgs/min-copy-closure/liminix-rebuild.sh
to add /boot

we could make the contents of /boot a derivation and then
/boot itself is just a symlink to it. we would need to ensure that
the derivation is part of the system closure, though

- make rootfs the directory structure

Sun Dec  3 23:31:35 GMT 2023

Spent too much of the weekend first fighting run-liminix-vm.sh and
then rewriting it in Fennel, but we are now at the point that we can
boot u-boot in qemu. However, it maps the rootfs into high memory
where phram can find it, instead of putting it into a flash that
_qemu_ can see as flash, so u-boot is not able to boot the kernel or
at least not in a similar-to-hardware fashion. Once we've added that,
we need to write a test for boots-a-kernel-in-the-filesystem

Mon Dec  4 19:46:58 GMT 2023

We wanted a test that we are creating an image that u-boot can boot
using extlinux. Turns out that u-boot only has scripts to do this in
the case that the storage device has a partition table. Which is
representative of the Omnia mmc, but maybe not going to work for
jffs2/ubifs

(For ubifs it might be OK, there's some concept of partitions

ubifs_boot=if ubi part ${bootubipart} ${bootubioff} && ubifsmount ubi0:${bootubivol}; then devtype=ubi; devnum=ubi0; bootfstype=ubifs; distro_bootpart=${bootubivol}; run scan_dev_for_boot; ubifsumount; fi

)

So what do we need? a disk image with a partition table and an ext4fs
image in the only partition, and that partition to be bootable. Then
run-liminix-vm gets a --disk-image option which causes it to use
U-Boot instead of direct load (can we wrap it with something that sets
up the paths so it can find u-boot and qemu?)

ok, we're going to define outputs.diskimage which is like
outputs.flashimage but it has a partition table. Then we can make a
qemu configuration with an ext4 filesystem and defaultOutput="diskimage"
and config.boot.loader.extlinux.enable = true

sfdisk default behaviour for GPT partitioned disk is to start at sector 2048
(sectors are 512 bytes)

Device     Start   End Sectors Size Type
disk.bin1   2048 14335   12288   6M Linux filesystem

Need mbr not gpt. At least, it takes up less space and it doesn't
inveigle us into EFI boot.

This is close to working except that it doesn't want to boot a uimage

virtio devices don't have standard major/minor so we can't create
device nodes for them at build time. Either we mount devtmpfs in the
initramfs (do we then have to move it to /target?) or we parse the
/sys/block/vda/vda1/dev node to get 253:1 or whatever

Fri Dec  8 16:36:07 GMT 2023

We'd like to remove the ugly special handling of qemu dtb. Here are
some thoughts

1) qemu provides its guest the correct DTB for the configured hardware.
This is a desirable thing and we wish more platforms did it, so would
like not to replace it with a static dtb if we can avoid that

2) so we need some kind of config option that says "platform provides the
device tree" (or alternatively, "we need a static dtb, platform doesn't
provide it").

config.boot.platformProvidesDeviceTree



Monday

so where are we? we've removed the need for every hardware device to
be able to build flashimage, because not every hw device (looking at you,
bellkin/turris) works like that.

for the belkin we can have imports = [ modules/outputs/ubimage ]
and extlinux enabled

for the nwa from Raito we'd like to have imports = [ modules/outputs/ubimage ]
but the bootloader is mtd partition-based (or ubi volume? check?) -
so ubimage needs to know how to do that

perhaps we need an output for "smash together a kernel and a
filesystem image that does not also contain a kernel, and don't
put a partition table on the front"

diskimage {
  partitionType = "mtd" ;  # or "mbr" or maybe "gpt"
  partitions = [ o.uimage o.rootfs ];
}




for the turris we need to check but proceeding on the assumption
it wants a tarball with extlinux enabled

https://docs.turris.cz/geek/schnapps/schnapps/#export-and-import
https://wiki.turris.cz/en/howto/omnia_booting_from_external_storage

if we adopt this as our installation format then we are not
reformatting the flash and will keep the btrfs that the device
was shipped with.

https://forum.turris.cz/t/update-to-5-1-x-by-medkit/13986/12
suggests that we could install a custom medkit from the
vendor OS

=> btrsubvol mmc 0:1
ID 257 parent 5 name /@
ID 259 parent 5 name /@factory

there don't seem to be any other btr commands in u-boot

Tue Dec 12 14:38:53 GMT 2023

from the source code, to get to the various omnia revovery modes

uboot> setenv omnia_reset 3 # or 1..n
uboot> setenv boot_targets rescue
uboot> boot

// reset boot_targets to default value.

Tue Dec 12 22:44:34 GMT 2023

The hold-down-reset-until-n-leds-flash support depends quite heavily
on the post-boot Linux environment, in that it appears to be passing
omniarescue=3 rescue_mode=3 to the kernel command line -> pid 1
cmdline

On the other hand, it is described as being able to boot from usb
stick if there's a boot.scr on the usb stick, so maybe we just do
that. The installation process could then be "boot usb, dd the
disk image to mmc, reboot, remove usb, realise we got the wrong root=".
Hmm.

* Could we edit extlinux.conf for first boot? But bear in mind it's a
link to a store file.

* Could we have extlinux.conf point at mmc0 and somehow override it for the
usb stick boot?

* Could preinit try multiple root mounts until it gets one that works?

* maybe we could detect omniarescue on kernel command line and switch to
usb root?

* maybe outputs.usbstick could generate a customised rootfs image?
it might be unworkable to

(narrator: it boots from mmc0 first and usb stick second, so that's not
particularly useful)

Fri Dec 15 19:21:53 GMT 2023

Let's put some English words on the page to explain the above
gibberish. Since I upgraded the U-Boot on my Turris Omnia, it has
stopped being able to tftpboot.

Uncompressing Kernel Image
lzma compressed: uncompress error 7
Must RESET board to recover

"uncompress error 7" means there is not enough space in the output
buffer, and the output buffer is set by CONFIG_SYS_BOOTM_LEN which is
8192k, smaller than the uncompressed 12104200 of our kernel.

So how can we fix?

* one possibility is to do what the turris rescue mode does: build an
uncompressed uimage and then lzma the result.  u-boot can uncompress
the received file using lzmadec command. we'd want to do this without
breaking tftpboot on every other device that might not have an lzmadec
command

* is there bloat in the kernel we could trim? probably not 4MB of it

* we could build a custom u-boot with a bigger buffer. this _might_
not be a completely stupid idea as it's only the people prepared to
open the box that would be doing tftp workflows anyway, so provided
it's possible to replace u-boot without bricking it

* we could try building zimage instead of uimage and use bootz to
start it

Sat Dec 16 11:15:56 GMT 2023

there is another use case for weird tftpboot derivation, which is the
device Raito has ported to where you need to wave a magic chicken at
u-boot on each command line

Sat Dec 16 23:32:11 GMT 2023

Turns out that even when using an uncompressed uimage, u-boot runs the
code to check the decompressed size, so that doesn't help at all.  But
booting a zImage works fine. I am committing a first pass of
modules/outputs/tftpbootlz.nix which does this using a lot of
copy-paste and (ironically) no lzma stuff at all.

Sun Dec 17 16:25:30 GMT 2023

it's started failing to mount root on arm32 because it's not recognising
the reserved-memory and something is trashing the phram filesystem

        reserved-memory {

                phram-rootfs {
                        reg = <0x1400000 0x1900000>;
                        compatible = "phram";
                };
        };

Sun Dec 17 17:13:54 GMT 2023

* We need to write the fdt phram differently on 64 bit vs 32 bit
  (address-cells and size-cells should be 2 or 1)

* this might be why it wasn't working on mips (can we test this
somehow in qemu or do we need to plug a device in?)

qemu user-mode networking has a builtin tftp server.

so we need a test that builds the tftpboot target for each qemu arch,
and then does run-liminix-vm with the --lan and --u-boot options, then
drives it with expect


* maybe tftpboot[lz] could be reintegrated with the regular one somehow

Fri Dec 22 15:11:35 GMT 2023

We have a working test for tftpboot, on all platforms, which took a
while.

* tftpbootlz needs to be updated with what we learned, or merged
back into it

* omnia install

- build a stripped-down installer image which can be put on a
 usb stick
- from openwrt on the device, use fw_setenv to set boot order
- boot into the installer image-
 reformat the emmc as per requirements
- PREFIX=/mnt  liminix-rebuild
- profit

Could we liminix-rebuild into /some/prefix/nix/store this would
actually be useful both for this boot-from-usb scenario and for
levitate. Looks like min-copy-closure doesn't need anything much on
the destination system except a working sshd and maybe an empty
/nix/store and /persist. Potentially we could even do it without
chroot (which would save running a second sshd), just add a prefix on
the paths

what's the fallback? we're not touching the turris rescue
system (which is in nor flash) so we can expect all the
knightrider modes to continue to workto be able to
boot back into that and restore the vendor os? I think so

Fri Dec 22 16:56:40 GMT 2023

If we're going to use fw_setenv to change boot order,
we could equally well boot from tftp and not need the
usb stick

fw_setenv boot_targets "tftp mmc0 nvme0 scsi0 usb0 pxe dhcp"
setenv bootcmd_tftp "echo TFTP BOOT"

how can we get a tftp boot into few enough characters to reasonably
put it in an environment variable?
- use dhcp?
- embed bootargs into the fdt

Fri Dec 22 21:10:53 GMT 2023

* dtb needs size and offset of uncompressed root filesystem to add
reserved-memory and cmdline params

* setting these in the dtb will change the size of the dtb

* am assuming that we don't want the kernel to relocate into
 ram that clashes with the root fs

* should we care about phys mem fragmentation?

conclusion:

hardware.loadAddress
		  <uncompressed/relocated kernel>
tftp.loadAddress
		  <space for uncompressed root>
		  uimage or zimage
		  dtb
		  compressed root


[ should we rename hardware.loadAddress to something that expresses
more clearly it's the _kernel_ load address? ]

[ another thing we need to do is stop building two kernels
 because the uimage and zimage derivations are different ]

Sat Dec 23 18:07:43 GMT 2023

Addendum: for a zimage we need the compressed kernel to be at the
highest address, otherwise it prints "Starting" and then hangs
indefinitely.

I believe this to be because the kernel decompressor sets up a stack
directly after the compressed payload, so will trash the fdt if it was
also there. The bug didn't exhibit on Turris Omnia with the same
layout, but maybe that was just luck.

Sat Dec 23 18:11:04 GMT 2023

Here is scope of work for Turris:

(I) we need to build a suitable tftpboot image for
recovery/install.

- disk partitioning tools and mkfs stuff
- kernel with all the filesystems
- dhcp client for connecting to wired network

(II) we need instructions for building the real system
and using min-copy-closure to copy and install the system
configuration of the real one into /mnt

(III) probably try the same recovery image as a USB stick

(IV) I've lost track of what we're doing with /boot, does that work?

(V) gpio thingy for SFP switching

(VI) iperf, performance testing

(VII) put device name and usefulness tiers ("stable", "experimental", "wip") in the docs

(VIII) params for ubi(fs) are a mess

(IX) wlan country code

Tue Dec 26 16:23:37 GMT 2023

I seem to have lost a chunk of notes here. Have added
systemConfiguration/bin/install which does the stuff to copy the right
files into /bin and wherever. There is currently no test for it though

We could further simplify liminix-rebuild by adding --reboot as a flag
to install

Tue Dec 26 21:38:43 GMT 2023

To be any use, the test needs to be end-to-end - as in, rather than
just checking some files are copied, test that the machine rebooted
successfully

Fri Dec 29 18:36:16 GMT 2023

Our test for liminix-rebuild uses qemu block device and ext4 instead
of phram because -device loader doesn't seem to survive a reboot.
And it needs some free space in the ext4 partition inside the
mbr image so that it can install new stuff. However, the
filesystem is sized to be near-full.

If the mbrimage output is to be much use, probably there should be
some way of telling it how big the disk is. Maybe it should use
hardware.flash.size?

UBI also does a bad job of integrating into the hardware.flash hierarchy
(but ubi is also more complicated as the ubi volumes are "nested" inside
an MTD partition)

To move forwards with this test I think I will make it not depend on
mbrimage for now, but we have to come back to this. Maybe importing
the mbrimage module provides new hardware.disk = { partitions, size etc}
config options.

Sun Dec 31 23:52:04 GMT 2023

https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php/Setting_up_fw_printenv_to_modify_u-boot_environment_variables#Preparing_the_fw_env.config_file

can we extract the fw_env config data somehow to produce an appropriate
file for the device?

the device config needs to specify partition name and offset at minimum,
possibly also size.

we can create a service that writes the config based on those values. but
if we are to be using fw_setenv from the shell, there is no service
which depends on that service. whatever defines the service also needs
to add it to system.services so that the recovery system can specify it

Sat Jan  6 12:30:27 GMT 2024

How do we min-copy-closure to the device when we don't have anything
hooked to the LAN port? It's rather easy to break the WAN  connection
when it involves going out to the internet and back

* Don't want to plug it into the actual lan because it's doing dhcp service
 and that is going to confuse

* the machine we're copying from is loaclhost

* we could do some kind of port forwarding thing? maybe a port forward on
  run-border-vm qemu user networking ...

* static route on loaclhost?

  512  sudo ip netns add test-lan
  514  sudo ip link set dev enp1s0 netns test-lan

  525  sudo ip link add veth-test-lan type veth peer veth1 netns test-lan
  533  sudo  ip netns exec test-lan ip link add name br0 type bridge
  536  sudo  ip netns exec test-lan ip link set veth1 master br0
  537  sudo  ip netns exec test-lan ip link set enp1s0 master br0
       sudo  ip netns exec test-lan /nix/store/dh66q9k402pwpmmgc983xwmwb3vvvjbr-busybox-1.36.1/bin/busybox udhcpc -i br0

then we could add a route to 10.8.0.1/32 with dev veth-test-lan ?

Sat Jan  6 20:52:45 GMT 2024

This is all beside the point right now because the _recovery_ system
does not run all this stuff - it just has a dhcp client on the lan
interface. We could plug it straight into the switch.


As we already just plugged it into enp1s0 on loaclhost, could we
do somethin to put it on the lan from there? add it to vbridge0?

Sun Jan  7 15:30:57 GMT 2024

Turns out we should have used a working ethernet cable.

Sun Jan  7 15:31:14 GMT 2024

OK, so

# on device
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
 [ take a snapshot if needed ]
 [ clear out the turrisos files ]
ls /mnt/@

# on build

$ nix-build -I liminix-config=./examples/rotuer.nix --arg device "import ./devices/turris-omnia" -A outputs.systemConfiguration
$ nix-shell --run "min-copy-closure -r /mnt/@  root@recovery.lan   result "

# on device

$ mkdir /mnt/@/persist
$ /mnt/@/nix/store/swf3vn9bzx198c0cwp6naq0glqa9192n-make-stuff-armv7l-unknown-linux-musleabihf/bin/install /mnt/@/

this fails because it tries to copy from the unprefixed nix
store. Also probably it should mkdir $prefix/persist. Also it needs to
create $prefix/boot: it's too late to do that with `activate`
because u-boot will need it to exist in order to load the initramfs
that runs activate

Before calling the Omnia "done" I'd like to get it to the point that
I can actually use it as a CPE. This means

- writing something down about how we handle static addresses
  - hosts that need static ipv6 can configure it themselves as ::n
    where n is a small number. this won't clash with slaac
  - the `hosts` param to dnsmasq can specify static ipv4

- dealing with port forwards and allowed incoming in the firewall

- would be quite cool to run sniproxy instead of forwarding to
  loaclhost (extra credit)

ARGH KERNEL

You can't define CONFIG_NETFILTER=y in a monolithic kernel and expect
later to separately build some modules that use it, because there are
a bunch of symbols that only get defined if certain other CONFIG
options are set at the time that the monolithic kernel is built.

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/netfilter/core.c#L689

Another example is
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/netdevice.h#L160
- if you decide after building the kernel that you're going to build
some wireless modules, you can't do that without rebuilding the kernel
so that it knows to expect them

The moral of the story seems to be: if you have a compiled Linux kernel source tree and you change some symbol from "is not set" to m and then run  make modules, you cannot in general expect that newly compiled  module to work.

Before we put this back live, would be good to

[done] 1) move the leases file into /persist

I think we'll do /persist/service/<name>/ and change ssh to use the same
scheme.

we could put mkpersist() in serviceFns which would check for /persist
and return a directory in /persist/service/ or /run/service-state

(will something bad happen if we use /run/service-state? it will also
expose the thingy as an output, but whether it's accessible that way
will depend on whether there's a writable fs or not, which is unexpected)

: rename service-state to  /run/services/outputs
: on boot
:  if /persist
:    create /persist/services/state and symlink /run/services/state to it
:  else create /run/services/state


[done] 2) maybe change the local domain back to .lan?  setting up
  systemd-networkd with search domains is an awful faff

[done] 3) work out what to do with incoming ssh from wan

- For noetbook and thinkpad we have a vpn anyway so can expect to
  reach loaclhost directly using ipv6

- stop ssh from ever trying to get to our ipv4 address.
  - we could get rid of A record for loaclhost.telent.net but
    there are a bunch of CNAMES pointing at it for web servers.
  - we could reject incoming connections to tcp4 port 22 in firewall
    and then there is a clear signal to Dont Do That Then

- for emergency use, dnat ipv4 2200 and 2201 to rotuer and loaclhost

Tue Feb 13 22:31:03 GMT 2024

* the reason we can't reboot is that there is a service to add each
lan device to the bridge which does ifwait $dev running, which doesn't
return until there's something plugged in. So s6-rc hangs indefinitely
until the lan switch is fully populated. This is definitely a "next
milestone" thing.

* another example of "thing that depends on other thing but which it
  is actually OK if neither of them happen" might be "mount a
  filesystem if there is a usb mass storage device attached"

* I don't know if failover also fits into the model we don't quite
  have. LTE route depends on pppoe not being healthy

we can have services (or bundles) that aren't part of the default target,
and plumb them into events of some kind (netlink?) to bring them up/down?

we can use s6-rc instanced services:
https://skarnet.org/software/s6/instances.html

"s6-instance-create and s6-instance-delete are relatively expensive operations, because they have to recursively copy or delete directories and use the synchronization mechanism with the instance supervisor, compared to s6-instance-control which only has to send commands to already existing supervisors. If you are going to turn instances on and off on a regular basis, it is more efficient to keep the instance existing and control it with s6-instance-control than it is to repeatedly create and delete it. "

Probably we need something that reads netlink messages and converts
them to a format that we can use to control services. Is there a
benefit to using services here and not just running commands? it means
the system state change we desire will stay changed.

TODO items not to lose track of

- speed testing (iperf)
- make gl-ar750 tftpboot build again
- finish belkin
- install sniproxy
- is there something simple we can do to make it reboot again?
- turn rotuer,extneder examples into "profiles" that don't embed
  hardware specifics

1) to make tftpboot work with old bootm implementations we need

- compressed root
- uncompressed root
- kernel with dtb
 dtb needs to know where uncompressed rootfs is and how big

2) if the image is a zImage (arm32) or an Image (arm64) we have to stick
with the three-arg bootz, and the dtb has to be lower in ram than the kernel

DHCP6c refresh is still wrong. We get updates for an address that
hasn't changed prefix or length, when the expiry times have changed,
and we can't action that by remove;add because remove will wipe out
any routes through the interface but add won't put them back

We can use "change" for both adds and changes, but we need to know that
a change is not a delete

The "identity" of an address is the address itself: kernel won't
let you add the same address with two different prefixes.

Keeping it simple, we could call "change" on every address in the
new-addresses list and "del" on every address in old-addresses
that is no longer in new-addresses

If the upstream has changed length, "ip addr change" is ignored,
so it needs to be in deleted as well as added/changed

We made it a full week with rotuer running internet chez nous and no
need for an intervention, so I am happy to call it "production". There are
still things that need fixing but they're mostly within scope for
a services refresh

I have embarked on "profiles" by creating a wap.nix

I think we could have a service module for resolvconf

It would be good to build a wap.nix example for the belkin and we
could start looking at ubifs

I've lost a chunk of notes about using events to drive desired service
state. There is probably only going to be one udev listener, so
what if we have udev as a config key thusly

udev.rules = [
{
  match = {
   SUBSYSTEM = "rpmsg";
    ATTR.name = "DATA5_CNTL";
  };

  service = longrun {
    name = "lte-modem";
    run = "blah blah blah";
  };
}

# this one would be provided by the bridge module instead of
# adding bridge member services to the default target

{
  match = {
    SUBSYSTEM="net";
    ID_PATH="pci-0000:04:00.0";
    ATTR.operstate = "up";
  };

  service = oneshot {
    up = "ip link set dev $dev master $(output ${primary} ifname)";
    down = "ip link set dev $(output ${member} ifname) nomaster";
  }
}
]

This works for udev/sysfs, but we want a similar architecture(sic) for
user-generated target state so we could have services that run on e.g.
"is the ppp0 service healthy" or not. Probably there isn't a top-level
config key for each service though

services.wan = svc.ppoe.build   { .... };
services.lte = watcher.build {
  watching = services.wan;
  match =  {
    # an expression matching the outputs of the service
    # to be watched
    health = "failing";
  };
  service = oneshot {
    run = "start_lte_blah";
  };
}

thing is, we could use this syntax also for sysfs watches, but not vice versa

... but it's not quite the same because here we're doing static matches
on contents of files, whereas the udev one is a query expression on the
sysfs database. we might need that flexibiity to implement "mount the
backup drive no matter _which_ damn sda_n_ device it appears as". I don't
know if there's the same need for service outputs - postulate the
existence of a collection of services which are all similar enough that
some other service can watch them all and do $something when one of
the changes state. Or a single service with very complicated outputs.
For example, something could watch the snmp database and update service
status depending on what it finds. Or something something mqtt...

we find that the "match" needs to be interpreted differently according
to the thing being watched. perhaps the service being watched needs to
provide a "watch me" interface somehow which accepts match criteria and
outputs a true/false. Something else then needs to


services.addmember = services.udev.watch {
  match = {
    SUBSYSTEM = "net";
    ID_PATH = "pci-0000:04:00.0";
    ATTR.operstate = "up";
  };

  service = oneshot {
    up = "ip link set dev $dev master $(output ${primary} ifname)";
    down = "ip link set dev $(output ${member} ifname) nomaster";
  };
}

Sat Mar  2 15:37:29 GMT 2024

Simply put, what I think it boils down to is that we want a service
which acts as an actuator or control switch for another service,
and will start/stop that controlled service according to some
criteria.

services.addmember = svc.network.ifwatch.build {
  interface = config.hardware.networkInterfaces.lan1;

  # this should be part of the definition not the params
  service = oneshot {
    name = "member-${bridge}-${interface}";
    up = "ip link set dev $dev master $(output ${primary} ifname)";
    down = "ip link set dev $(output ${member} ifname) nomaster";
  };
}

we could start by writing this. we need to adapt ifwait

Sun Mar  3 17:09:21 GMT 2024

this is annoyingly hard to test. the tests we'd like to write are

1) when it gets events that don't match the requirement, nothing happens
2) when it gets an event that should start the service, the
  service starts
3) when stop should stop
4) when start and already started, nothing happens
5) when stop and already stopped, nothing happens

what do we do if service fails to start? s6-rc will eventually reset it
to "down", I think: do we need to take action?

What happens when we attempt to start the service but it fails?  We
assume the start was successful so we won't try and restart it again
next time we get an event that should cause it to start.

Thu Mar  7 11:48:26 GMT 2024

what next?

- fennel script needs to know where s6-rc is
- some nix syntax
- update bridge module members.nix to use the new thing

I can't find a ci derivation that uses the bridge.
